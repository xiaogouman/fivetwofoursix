  * My original Review gave this five stars and this is what I had to say about it : I agonized long over the choice of printers . Ultimately , I went with the Samsung because I decided that if I was going to hate a printer and have paper jams ( which users complain about with every printer ) , I 'd rather complain for about a hundred to two hundred dollars less . So far , I have nothing to complain about . The printer was / startlingly / easy to set up for a non-technical type such as myself . The print quality is beautiful . The most annoying thing about this printer is the top-feeder . It doesn't hold a lot of paper , and needed to find a place to put the printer that is low enough for me to load it easily . I have it low by my right arm , it 's easy to load , and it has an excellent slot for envelopes that is entirely separate from the paper feeder . Gone are the days of removing the paper supply from the ink jet , loading an envelope manually , printing it , then putting the paper supply back . Woo hoo ! * Now a scant few months later ( 7/17/02 ) I 'm changing it to four stars : The printer just up and died one day . Completely and utterly . It wouldn't print . And the test page came out solid black . I called Samsung who said they would fix it , since it was under warranty , but I had to find an authorized Samsung repair place . They found one for me , but it was all the way across the city . I emailed them my amazon receipts , which they honored , and I 'm getting the printer back tomorrow . I can't say as I 'm thrilled that it would have such a major mechanical failure within months of owning it . The fact that I missed it so much while it was gone and refused to return to my reliable inkjet , says much about how it spoils you , however . * Now 12/18/02 I 'm again forced to lower my score for the printer . As it turns out , the repair person was never able to fix the printer . Samsung had to ship me a ' refurbished ' replacement . They had the courtesy to extend the warranty on the replacement , but now I 'm finding a new problem altogether . The only place to buy toner for this printer is now Amazon . com , who is selling them through Office Depot , who today told me they weren't going to carry it anymore . In order to get it shipped on time , I had to buy it from Samsung 's own site at almost $ 100 and I have to now wait for it to arrive . It seems to me that Samsung is abandoning this printer . Very uncool .
  I have had the same snow problem as others describe in the reviews . I cleaned the heads - tried everything . One thing the unit does well is heat the room . Samsung produced a portable worldwide heater , capable of warming a small sized bedroom in just under an hour . If the VCR portion doesn't work for you , I recommend using it as a heater . Very satisfied with my heater purchase .
  I had a simple problem ; my clock radio has poor reception , despite the fact that it 's a fairly expensive brand . In fact , every clock radio has poor reception . I live in a brick house , which I 've learned adds to the problem , with a lot of other electronics in the house , which adds to the problem . However , I like to listen to the conservative AM radio guys rant and rave in the morning , and I like to listen to the liberal NPR FM radio station guys tell stories on the weekend . That station is in the low end of the band , fades at night , and has a fairly feeble signal besides . This radio brings all the stations in , with super clarity , easy , no-nonsense tuning , and just simply does what it is supposed to do . No digital doodads , no flashing lights , it 's not trying to be a radio and a cell phone and an ipod and a mini-fridge . Just a radio that works well . If you search on the internet , you 'll find that a lot of guys are putting after market or even home-made antennas on this thing . Don't worry about it - these are the radio-geeks who like to try to see if they can sit in LA and pull in stations from the next state , just to see if they can . No add-on antennas or anything silly will be required if what you want is simply a radio that works - can find a station and keep it tuned in , no static , decent sound , great clarity . Update : I bought the radio in 2005 . It is now 2012 and the radio is still working like new !
  I sent this to by brother serving in the Army and it was great for him ! He could watch tv and not disturb the others around him , which is great considering no one works the same schedule . :)
  The Garmin is a simple and accurate GPS and my son is extremely happy with the unit . It was delivered as promised and in good condition . Another great job Amazon !
  I 'm not an audio expert . With that said I think these headphones sound pretty good for the price . I honestly don't find anything wrong with sound . This is not something overly bass heavy so if that 's what you 're looking for don't get this . The guy who said he was looking for headphones that sounded great , not just great for the price , should really have thought just a little harder about his choice to get sub-$50 headphones . These do sound better than your average " no-name ear-buds . " Trust me , I was stuck with no-name ear-buds for quite a while . Isolation isn't amazing , but is still a large improvement over conventional ear-buds . When I ride my bus I still hear the engine and such , and only until the music is about louder than I normally like it is when I can't hear people . Comfort is a slight problem . The foam muffs don't rest on my ear necessarily , and they don't really go around it either . However , they 're not unbearable and I can wear for about an hour or so , take a short rest , and put them on again . The way this thing is made seems like it will last and doesn't look like cheap plastic . The cord is nice and thick and looks like it can stand a bit of damage . At the price this thing is , if you want a good , cheap alternative to say , iPod headphones , get this . The value is amazing . Overall 4/5Sound 5/5Isolation 3/5Comfort 4/5Value 5/5
  Bought this for my Sony DSC-W55 camera . It seems to do the trick . Good amount of memory for the price and a nice alternative to the Sony memory .
  Just introduced my wife to DSLR with a D60 Nikon . This is the perfect lens for the novice photographer to compliment the 18-55 that came with it at a very reasonable price .
  since I have owned many Hewlett Packard printers it was hard to switch over . Now I am amazed why I didn't do it sooner ! Speedy , color-laserquality prints . And , of course , the USB connection . Too bad it 's hard to share it over a network .
  I was hesitant buying this after reading mixed reviews . What a relief when it arrived ! Fit and finish is exceptional for the price . Easy to focus , crystal clear image . It 's SUPER light and easy to slip in a pocket or wherever . My only complaint is the eye relief . You kind of have to jam your eye on there to get the max field of view . Oh , and the lanyard is kind of a joke , it doesn't even fit over my hand . But for 10 bucks you can't go wrong here . I 'm very happy with it !
  Holds steady as advertised and avoids the hassle of windshield suction cups altogether . Very pleased with the mount .
  This is an excellent camera . It has been replaced by the K20D and subsequently by the superb K7 . The K10D still holds its own against these more modern DSLR and others from other manufacturers . It has a robust feel of a solid device for taking pictures . It oozes quality . Some features are 10MP sensor , Shake Reduction ( SR ) , weather sealed body , large viewfinder , dust removal system , unique to Pentax exposure modes , a one touch RAW button and much more . Image quality is good . I like the color rendition and depth it produces . One thing I like about Pentax is with an adapter you can mount their old Asahi Takumar lenses . These lenses are all metal construction with build quality in the Zeiss and Leica level . They are manual focus only but have first class optics . Of course you can get modern autofocus lenses from fixed focal length , zooms , wide angle and weather resistant versions . The Pentax K10D is a great camera . A bit dated now but still effective . If you can find one pick it up , it could be a great backup camera .
  My camera went bad from a VERY COMMONLY reported manufacturing defect " camera stabilizer is not available " error message in the model I had . Since this is a common defect from the manufacture , they should have fixed my camera at their expense , but they refused to fix it without me having to pay for their manufacturing defect plus shipping charges ! Don't buy Casio products ! They don't stand behind the quality of their products .
  This case is a great little case for netbooks . It is big enough , with extra pockets to hold all the extras you may be carrying around with the netbook , like a power cord , mouse , and possibly even an external cd drive . Construction seems to be high quality . I would have given this thing perfect reviews EXCEPT .. It does not come with a shoulder strap , multiple other buyers mentioned this in their reviews as well . I contacted Targus ' customer service and was basically told " sorry , tough luck , here is one you can buy for the same price as what the whole case cost you " . Even though the description here on amazon , on targus ' website , and on the product packaging clearly states and shows it with a padded shoulder strap . Since a strap to allow it to be carried hands free is kind of the whole point of getting this case , that one ommision cost it 4 stars . Some other reviewers seemed to have luck getting a replacement strap from Targus but they pretty much ignored me so don't hold your breath .
  Considering how much landscaping costs , there 's little reason to scrimp on timers . I learned this the hard way , coming home from vacation to find my yard brown and parched . This timer , which was less than a year old had failed , and as a result , so did my grass . I 'm now in the market for a new one that actually works .
  This Item works great and is very handy But it quit working after 5 months .
  I bought this product based on reviews indicating how great the product is supposed to be . All I can say is that if you 're not a compute genius , this product won't help you much . Problem starts with the installation CD which is not compatible with Windows XP . No update is availabe on Socket 's site . Try downloading other programs such as Windows CE and there is more frustration . Customer service is terrible based on a wait of a least 24 or more hours for Emails and 48 hours plus if you call and leave a message on voice mail . Without the installation CD working with Windows XP , my new Sharp Zaurus is worthless . Furthermore , Socket makes you print up your own directions through Acrobat Reader . I paid [ money amount ] for the low power WLAN Card . Socket could furnish a direction book . This Card may eventually work with my Zaurus ( Sharp site mentioned Socket as one of the cards to use ) , but getting to that point is far more difficult than any other program I 've ever come across . In 99.9 percent of the cases you load the CD-rom and go . Not with Socket . I 'm no computer genius , but I 'm not stupid either . Be prepared for frustration if you don't have Windows CE .
  This was such an awesome purchase . I have an extra laptop that my daughter uses and this makes it so much easier for her to get to her sites . She can completely operate this on her own and the password keeps her only on those sites . I picked up some of the extra links and the games are perfectly appropriate for her . I love it ! Only down side is that the sites are limited . I wish there were some Nick Jr. Characters like Dora or lazy town .
  I haven't opened the package yet , so this is not a functional review . I bought this for my wife to use with her Powerbook on business trips . I read the name of the mouse , saw that it pitches it 's " Compact " size , that it has a travel bag and thought that it was a wireless version of the tiny Kensington mice I 've seen in the store . Wrong . This thing is huge ! It 's bigger than a Microsoft Inellimouse . It would barely fit in my pocket - the name and description are misleading to the extent that they border on false advertising . I plan to return this mouse and keep looking .
  I just purcahse a version 5 of the wrt54g . Everything seemed to be working great untill i did a speed test . my computer hard wired into the lan port , horrible download speed ( normally 5000kbps , behind router - 250-800 kbps . Called tech supp . after 3 hours , i was told , to bring unit back and try to find a version 4 of the router , that they didnt have a ' stable ' firmware yet . they could not tell me if this unit was bad or it was by design . I would definitly avoid this unti untill a few firmware updates are out .
  I bought this system today and I am very impressed with what I got for under $ 200 . The picture quality and sound are amazing . I tested out my only 2 DVDs ( Jaws and The Sixth Sense ) and they run great . So if you want a good , but affordable machine , buy this one now !
  I bought 2 Pkgs . of these super duper AA rechargeable batteries that were advertised as an accessory to the Magic Flight vaporizer . They were supposed to hold a much longer charge than the ones that come with it . THEY DON'T FIT ! They are fat . I can only get them into my camera & a few other items , and it 's a tight squeeze .
  I bought these after seeing them very highly rated on a consumer rating site . I 've just used them a couple of times , and find they are everything promised - easy to focus , focus very close up , quite light and comfortable . I find it a little difficult to get the interpupillary distance just right ( that is , the distance between the eyepieces so there isn't a shadow around the field of vision ) and it tends to alter while being carried so has to be fixed repeatedly . But that 's getting easier with practise . The only complaints I have are with the ' extras '- like the snap-on eyepiece protector which is designed to be fixed on the strap . It doesn't stay on the eyepieces so doesn't actually provide any protection while walking with them - and the thin plastic slot that holds it on the strap tore the first day out . The product logo ( a tiny bit of plastic glued on the binocs themselves ) came off the first day - not that it serves a purpose , but for the price these cost you don't expect things to fall off ! And the strap is difficult to put on and to adjust . Overall , I think I would buy these again and recommend them - but I wonder why the manufacturers would have poor-quality stuff on such a high-quality piece of equipment ?
  The concept is sensational . The unit performs well , when it works . The ear phones are shameful and the ipod is aided by the purchase of Sony headphones , for example . That 's a measure of the attention to detail by Apple . The earphones are tinny and unacceptable . The unit has malfunctioned numerous times and ceased to operate altogether . This has been replaced 3 times , going for 4 , and the assistance is always polite , but usually inept . I 'd go for a different brand for my portable music in the future .
  We have had a monitor like this for close to 3 years and it hasn't worked correctly for the last year . The screen will get all spotty and do odd things then it will go blank and I can't get to come back on . We couldn't find the warrenty papers so my brother in law took it apart to try and fix it . He contacted the company and they said if he sent it back they would fix it for $ 20 so he asked for the address and he has never heard back . You can't talk to a human and they won't email him back .
  Well , I 've had mine for about 7 months now and still love it . I really like it 's small size so I normally carry it in a cheap cell-phone holder on my belt . No real problems with battery life at this stage ( and I shouldn't have either ) . The face plate control was a little fiddly , but no interface is going to be perfect so you just get on with it . I REALLY like the fact it has a radio , it was a big selling point to me as I listen to a lot of talk-radio during the day . I was leary of the iPod because of it 's battery changing problem ( you have to send it back to Apple ) . Don't know if it is the same deal with the Zen Micro , but I hope not . Only gripe is I have to charge it via the USB cable , there is no seperate power adapter ( that I can see ) . I tried to charge it with a lap-top that did not have the Zen software installed , and it did not charge ! Even when I left it overnight . I don't understand why it didn't charge . Having the software installed shouldn't make a difference .. For my birthday I ditched the little white ear-buds that came with it and splurged on a set of Shure E2c noise insulating ear buds . Man what a difference ! They are not noise-cancelling , but work like an ear-plug , blocking out external noise . [ .. ] Highly recommended . There are plenty of in-depth , technical reviews out there already , so I will not bother repeating them here . Two thumbs up !
  Jury is still out on my foot pod as i haven't been able to get it to sync up with my forerunner 305 ( with the latest s / w load ) yet . Will need to contact support line for assistance .
  Would be a great product if it worked as advertised out of the box . Like other reviewers , my Mobilite was very picky about what SD ( SDHC ) cards would work and what didn't . I never had a problem reading MicroSD cards though . One Sandisk 2GB card would read , but another Sandisk wouldn't , tried other brands , same results . It wouldn't read my Transcend 16GB SDHC . I noticed that if I slowly slid a card that wasn't working , with the Mobilite plugged into the USB socket ( not recommended ) , it would start to read when it was mostly in the socket ( the green light would turn on ) , but would stop working once I pushed it in all the way . I got fed up with the thing , so I cracked it open from the back so I could get to the pins on the inside . I bent the outside pins on each side , that contact the metal on the circuit board , and pushed the inside pins up more . After snapping the Mobilite back together , my 16GB SDHC card reads , along with the other cards that didn't . Its up to you if you want to go to that extreme to make the product work or just skip it all together .
  This is the 2nd PCIx1 sound card that I bought for the same Gigabyte motherboard . The first card , an Asus Xonar card , crashed while playing certain games . So , I bought the tried and true Creative . After about 5 minutes of use it emitted an ear-piercing scream - along the lines of a smoke alarm , or building fire alarm . I tried different ports , disconnecting the I / O drive - reinstalling the software - typical things one does to try to avoid the RMA process . Amazon tells me that the replacement is enroute , and I hope that the new one doesn't give me the same problem - because if it does then I 'd be looking at replacing the motherboard , assuming then that the sound card isn't the problem . If it does reoccur then I 'll try the card in another pc to see what happens . Also , since my experiences with Vista have been less than stellar I 've only used XP so I can't report on Vista performance .
  Don't get me wrong - I love this unit and had it installed correctly at Best Buy , installation quality was guaranteed . Up until a week or so ago , I used this unit every time I got in my car . Way better than radio , easy to use , and the sound quality beats even the best FM transmitters - furthermore you don't have to change stations every 2 miles living in a metropolitan area . The problem I have is that less than 9 months after installation , the USB cable adapter went on the fritz and only charged my mp3 players , no longer transmitting audio at all . Its extremely disappointing after spending close to $ 250 on the components and installation . I 'm writing this review because I 've contacted the company with these details and plan to update my review depending on how USA SPEC responds to my request for warranty authorization of the cable - if they do nothing , I will for sure drop this to a one star and not recommend them to anyone so you don't waste your money . If they replace the cable or better , I will revisit and upgrade my ratings depending on how timely and appropriate I think their response is . Its a shame that the design on QA was not better - Without this issue it certainly deserves a 5-star review . I absolutely had nothing but normal wear and tear during the past 8 months and have missed having it terribly . Stay tuned for an update ..
  I had one of these and I replaced it with a Gemini 2 way rewinder which is of a much higher build quality and runs more reliably than this one . The problems I experienced with this Ambico rewinder are : Very noisy , flimsy construction , Door getting stuck at times , Some tapes actually got tangled inside the reel of the tape itself while rewinding the last 12 inches or so . Like I said , if you can still find a Gemini rewinder go for it and ditch this piece of garbage .
  Software is not compatable with Vista , offerd Li-Ion Battery deal for $ 19.99 is not available - this is the worst company I have ever dealt with . Good thing I have a product protection plan on my CC
  I purchased the cordless phone jack for my DirecTV system , and it worked fine for three months . Then it broke down . I reset the system and it worked great for another two days before breaking down again . I decided I must have gotten a lemon ( it happens ) , and I purchased a new system . The new one lasted all of two weeks . So now I 'm running a 25 ' telephone cord across the living room , and hoping that someday in the near future the bugs will be worked out of this otherwise very handy technology .
  ( Negative 5 stars ) At first 5 starts , then .. with out warning .. disappointment . Well , mine lasted longer than the other reviewer 's and it is true it printed wonderful for a while , until this year when , AT RANDOM , it would print pages with out a top margin at all . After about a year of waisted paper and ( very expensive ) ink I decided to take it 300 miles to the nearest fix-it place because OF COURSE the warrenty had ended . I just received a call today from the tech guy , the part to replace it is $ 50 and labor is $ 60 and then to ship it back to me it would be over $ 100 ! I only paid $ 180 on Amazon in the first place ! So badbuy EPSON and hello HP . I plan to buy one soon . One more thing .. I had put away the LEXMARK 3200 when I bought the EPSON , the LEXMARK STILL WORKS and has USEABLE ink after one year of sitting without use . Just goes to show what a horrible mistake it was to buy epson CX6400 . Now I just have to figure out how to get that stupid epson back so I can give it to HP for a trade in and get some sort of rebate towards a new HP . Thanks for nothing Epson .. by the way the online tech support menus are a joke .
  Nice AM reception . FM is surprisingly poor . The building I 'm in makes it difficult , but my old el cheapo radio had better FM . So for me bottom line , great for AM , so so for FM .
  I have had two of these Bose Companion systems and both times one of the jacks in the back stopped working and only one speaker would work . I will never buy one of these again .
  1 . Nikon MH-63 Battery Charger for Nikon EN-EL10 Lithium-ion BatteryI ordered the extra cord , because the description did not mention that the charger came with it . 2 . My battery does not fit in the charger - a little too large . How do I send it back ?
  I 'm not sure what all could go wrong with an SD card , but it seems to be working just fine .
  I ended up buying a Parrot Asteroid , Polk Audio front and rear speakers , this sub , and a Lanzar OPTS 650.5 amp . Having my price for the whole ordeal to re-outfit my car 's stereo system reach almost $ 750 , budget was the only reason why I skimped on the last two items , the sub and the amp . SO far , the amp has pleased me , despite sub-par reviews . However , that 's not what this review is about . For the past two weeks , I 've been having issues with my subwoofer cutting in and out . It ended up pretty much not playing at all , and I feared my amp had died . I ran some tests , and had ruled out the speaker wire , power ( as it was running fine for a few months ) , the subwoofer volume-level remote , the audio source ( Pandora on my phone , music on my iPod , and FM radio all the same ) , RCA cables , and the fuses . I opened the amp , found some half-tinned but still continuitive joints , but everything else looked a-ok - no swollen or leaking caps , nothing burned , and it still had that electrical smell it had the day I got it , so it hadn't worried me . Today I tried some more things - connected the rear-out of my radio to the sub-in on the amp , and the sub-out of the amp to an old JVC door speaker I had . The speaker buzzed for a few seconds and then shut up and started smoking . Fried . Subwoofer did nothing this way , but at least I knew that the amp still had power to Ch . 5 ( sub ) . I ran my front speakers parallel on ch . 1 and the rears parallel on ch . 2 , then bridged 3 and 4 for the sub . Nothing on the sub 's end , but the speakers ran ( albeit a bit weak ) . At this point , I was fairly certain that it was the sub , but I still had a feeling it would be the amp . A fellow member on a gaming website I frequent told me , after I posted a topic about my woes , to check the resistance on the terminals with a voltmeter . It ought to have around 4 ohms resistance . If it 's low , it 's likely good ; high , going bad ; infinite / no continuity - it 's blown . There was no continuity . I decided , for reference , to check the remaining JVC speaker - 4.5 ohms ; the blown one , as expected , showed no continuity . I had this for about two or three months . While I had it , I ran it , and I ran it hard . It sounded pretty good for the most part , but the description saying it 's " rear vented " is a right lie - there are no vents on this at all . As a result , the speaker buffered a LOT of air , and you could hear it when the trunk was open . When it was closed , you could rarely hear it , but it still bothered me . The subwoofer was always a little weak for my liking , but I managed , and having an in-dash EQ helped . Bottom line - if you need something cheap and quick to start out with , this might be a good start . For the long run , stay away . There 's a good chance you 'll also need to vent the box yourself .
  I bought this to connect my notebook to my DI-624 at 108Mbps . It worked well enough and I didn't have any of the driver installation issues other reviewers have mentioned . However the D-Link drivers interfere with the Intel wireless drivers on Centrino notebooks - my internal wireless card stopped working and after I got D-Link customer support to acknowledge there was a problem , the only solution they could offer was to re-install Windows . Thanks guys . Also , I 've recently upgraded to a DI-634 router and I can no longer connect at 108Mbps if I have any kind of encryption turned on . This is probably a propblem with the router , but its worth knowing .
  Incredible how Nikon wants to get rid of its Nikofiliacs with this lens .. This lens is below criticism .. Forget your 10-12-or more MegaPix DSLR Nikon resolution .. This lens is so soft , you are lucky if you get a presentable 4x6 .. Don't believe me .. ( ? ) .. than get yourself a $ 200 point-and-shooter , like a Canon SX110 ( or equivalent ) and compare picture sharpness .. I did .. and I am about to cure myself from my expensive Nikon-centric addiction ..
  This computer is extremely poor quality . I got two units and they were both defective . The customer service is also very poor . For the same price , I got a really terrific Dell whose quality is 100 % better . Don't be fooled by the so-called low price and the features . This is a flimsy , badly made machine which is not worth the price .
  This CD player is just what I needed . No bell and Whistles jjust a player . Would have liked a remote but , other model not in stock . This works well and have no problem . I purchased from J & R MusicWorld . Good Seller and Fast !
  This unit is like owning a pet rattlesnake . Its exciting , fun to feed , easy to maintain , then one day it bites you on the face and you die ! Thats what my seagate freeagent has done to me . After a year of electronic bliss and feeding my drive all kinds of data , one day it just turned on me with endless errors and unable to access data . I 've spent countless hours trying to diagnose the problem , putting my work off to try to access my data . After days of research I 've come to learn that it is a HORRIBLE design flaw . With no cooling system , it will slowly bake itself ( and your beloved files ) to death . Then when you try to get help from Seagate , they 'll try to charge you to retrieve your data and treat you like crap ! Beware , you 're unit will certainly turn on you like it has thousands of buyers !
  Beware this product . Decent sound but absolutely no base . To make matters worse , the wires are flimsy , always kinked , and when they brush against anything ( like your clothing ) you hear an aggravating rustling . No carrying case either . Better to invest in Shure E2Cs , which are worth the extra money .
  This is a nice telephoto lens . You will need a wide angle lens for general photography . The macro function is a bit ackward since you must be 10 ' away from anything you are trying to shoot . Overall , I would buy this lens again for my Minolta Maxxum 5D . I put a skylight filter on it for protection .
  This card is absolutely perfect . I got it on ebay for 60 bucks , and I am completely satisfied with it . I upgraded from an ATI Radeon 9200se with 128mb ddr ram , and there is no comparison between the two . I can now run games like Halo , Call of Duty 2 , Half Life 2 , and Counter Strike Source at high graphic settings and experience no lag . My friend has the 256mb version of this card ( with only gddr2 memory ) and almost thinks mine is better ( since this one has gddr3 ) . I 'd highly recommend this card to anyone on a budget . Oh , and since it 's nvidia it 's really easy to overclock .
  OK , I have used one of these for nearly two years and loved it . I just ordered another , and it wouldn't work - the computers ( several ) had problems recognizing the USB device , and once recognized , the pointer always had to be re-trained . Not the plug and play device I can hand to an average user . So I returned the unit and ordered another - same thing . Don't know what 's happened , but I can no longer recommend this unit .
  I have been looking for a multi-tasking tripod and I have found it ! The Joby GP1-OBEN Gorillapod is incredibly versatile , very strong , sturdy , and easy to use ! The blue grips really help with keeping the camera steady in unusual positions . I have not had one bit of trouble with it ! I recommend this space-saving , well built tripod for anyone looking to enhance their camera kit !
  I have a dental office ; so the copier gets occasional use-about maybe 10 copies per day . In the beginning , the quality of the copies is good , but the start up time is consuming . After two years , the quality of the copies declined-the ends of the page were illegible . Finding someone to service the machine was difficult . There were long waits on the phone with Sharp customer service . With so many other options ( some of them with better longevity , more competitive pricing , and better customer support ) , I would look into buying other alternatives .
  Easy to start to use . I used for TV set . Once kill the sound of the TV itself , make sure TV volume 's up high to reduce the headset noise . Good to use & great price .
  My camera ( DSC-W100 ) , batteries , and memory stick pro duo all fit nicely , neatly , and snuggly in this compact case . The only drawback is that it doesn't come with a strap to carry on the shoulder or wrap around the wrist ; instead it has a loop for your belt and a clip for a strap ( not included ) .
  I absolutely love them . The sound quality is phenomonal , I 'm hearing things in songs I never even knew existed . The only thing I don't like about them is that the cord is so long . At home tha 's great but I like wearing them while I work out and it sometimes gets in the way . Overall , I am so glad I got them !
  As of firmware version 1.2.8 , this thing can't keep a network connection up very long . When moving large amounts of data , the WAP4400N tends to reboot . It has a nice form factor and was easy to install , but since I actually need a wireless network , I 'm sending this back .
  Being a Sony fan and expecting the customary good quality items one would normally receive .. this item is disappointing . It 's just not very good sounding and has some issues with hiss and pop occasionally . If it were a different company other than Sony I would probably give it more stars .
  Apparently , I have really small earholes . The earbuds that come with iPods really kill my ears after just 5 minutes , so I was really excited to get these earbuds , since they have 3 sizes to choose from . Sure enough , when I got them , I had to use the smallest size . It was a perfect fit , not only comfort-wise , but sound-wise too . They block out sound REALLY well . I take a very noisy bus to school and with my old headphones , I had to turn my iPod up all the way and I still couldn't hear the music that well . With these headphones , I can keep the volume at the same level as when I 'm not on the bus . I think they 're GREAT and would recommend them to anyone .
  I recieved this camera as a gift and while it worked alright for outside pitcures , in many of the indoor pictures , the flash caused the lighting to be drastically uneven .
  These things are incredibly loud . I didn't know that they would turn out to be this loud . Now when I 'm working on a project and I 'm using them , the kids come around thinking the Ice Cream Man is here . Great
  We 've all encountered crap radios .. this isn't one of them ! Great little radio , at a great price . Tremendous reception for such a small unit . Only downside is that there is no digital tuning , but that is only a minor problem . I can pull in a FM radio station on this little hand-held unit , from my hometown ( 30 miles away ) , with no problem .. whereas my " big " radio can't do it .
  I had a AH151 and it malfunctioned . I have a bunch of Hi8 tapes so needed a cam where I can continue to use them . I saw the AH150 from Classic Camcorder and the price was cheaper than the Authorized repair facility to fix the 151 . There was a slight delay on shipping but the Company notified me immediately and it was resolved and shipped . It arrive in quick time . For the price they threw in a few extras , a beautiful camera case , an EasyCap adapter to connect to the computer , and a lens cleaning kit . I tested the cam inside and outdoors and it works perfectly . I give Classic Camcorder an A + for Service and Delivery .
  I am currently trapped in a DirecTV contract . Every time it rains , the TV signal is lost . Additionally , DirecTV nickles and dimes me to death . They advertise you can get programming starting at $ 29.99 , but you will not get out for anything less than about $ 60.00 once they add all the hidden fees . Additionally , you must pay an extra $ 5 for each additional TV . We also have the DVR service which is so unreliable , we have to use a VCR as back-up to ensure we get our shows recorded . Recently , we had to move and suspended our account during the move . After we reactivated our account , we were charged late fees for bills we never received . Our contract was extended another two years without our consent . We called DirecTV service , and they do not care . Once my contract is over , we will be cancelling DirecTV to go back to cable .
  This is a great tv to watch HDTV , DVD 's , and play video games . And for the quality at the price - it 's a steal !
  Okay . Here is a write up , that I did , on the comparisons / contrasts on MP3 players . Mainly , the Harddrive versions ( I.E. Rio Riot / Apple IPOD - both of which I own ) and the flash memory type .. ( I.E. Memorex 3642 Mp3 Player , of which I own as well ) . What prompted this little jaunt ( of which you may send to as many people as you like ) My ( expensive ) Apple IPOD died during a sync last month . Just me copying files over to it , and the battery ran out of juice . I would have not attempted to copy music had I known the battery was low , but the battery read FULL STRENGTH . Anyhoo , I called Apple , they said return it for maintenance . I did . Sent it back . They returned it , still broke . To my suprise , there is only a TEN DAY return policy . TEN DAYS.I did not realize this at all .. and will not ever buy another apple product . So , after a month or so of messing around trying to find another MP3 player .. I decided to go with a flash memory MP3 player , the ones that use memory sticks . SO , here are the pro and cons of these devices . Pro 's for the Memory Stick Mp3 players-Cheaper . WAY CHEAPER than Hard drive types . - If you go into music match and file convert to MP3 Pro and shrink the size of your MP3 to like , say 3o percent .. you can really make a good Kompression . Example . My Memorex MP3 player has 32mbs of memory on board . It is expandable to 256mb . 32 mb will basically let you put one cd 's worth of music . It is easy to put music on and off of them , due to your computer reading the USB as just another hard drive , so you drag and drop to put on , delete them to take them off . But , after you shrink your files to MP3 Pro 30 percent , you can put twice as many . So , basically a 256mb chip will allow me to put 208 songs on my little less than palm size MP3 player . And it wieghs like 3 ounces . - More on memory . These little chips are the size of the upper part of your thumb , at least my thumb anyway . They come in 128mb , 256mb , 512mb and even though there aren't any MP3 machines out there to handle them YET , you can even buy a 1.5gig thumb size chip thingy . Considering the size of the chips and the shrinking kompression I told you about earlier , I could shrink my whole KOLLEKTION down to 10 of those 1.5gig chips . At the current shrink rate I am at 5 DVD 's , which are way bigger and more fragile than these little chips . - Not as fragile as hard drive type . You can drop one of these chips and not scratch it . I wouldn't stomp on one with my foot , nor get one in water , but they are encased in plastic . Ruggedish . - Batteries last for like two days . There isn't much going on here , no moving parts , no laser or hard drive to put power to . Most of these flash Memory types have a single AA battery . I use a rechargeable type , so we are talking very low cost here . In comparison to the hard drive types , where you will get a solid 8 hours of playing , this really whupps up . - Size . Small . Very small . Mine is three inches by three inches . A square . But , you can get smaller ones . And the memory chips that go in them are the same ones you use for your camera . And you can put files on them . If you want to put a word doc on your memory chip , you can . Your Mp3 won't recognize it , but it is nifty storage . COMPARISON / CONTRAST - Size does matter . In the case of hard drive Mp3 players .. lets face it , you can , if you so chose to , put a library of congress on these monsters . They are the caddilacs of the hand held devices , and guzzle batteries like gasoline . But when it comes down to it , size is the only thing they have going for them . I don't mean to downplay the hard drive types , but don't drop them , don't shake them , and after shelling out $ 499 to Apple you might consider insurance . Apple doesn't care about you or your apple after 10 days of ownership . - Price / Komparison . IPOD ran me $ 499 bucks . My memorex MP3 player ran me 45 dollars . The 128 memory chip runs you 50 bucks . Owch . There really isn't a comparison to the two . The memory stick Mp3 players just kick butt on this issue . And , you get MORE than a ten day return policy , since you buy these things at Target / Wal Mart etc .. So , that is my review in a nutshell
  Just finished a Javelina Hunt northwest of Oracle , Az . For the price I thought the Binoculars worked out well . Better than my old 10 X 25 for magnification . It took a little getting used to . My concerns were the instructions could have been printed LARGER ( Note to MFG . ) so you wouldn't need a magnify glass to read them .
  I love the size of this player . It 's great for when I run because I can fit the player , my cell phone and car keys in my tune belt and not know they 're there . Since I 've never used another mp3 player I can't say whether it 's easier or more difficult to use than others . But I found it pretty easy and intuitive to load w / the drop and drag software . I also like the variety of ways you can shuffle the tracks - within the entire player or just within a folder . This allows me to shuffle differently when I work out ( all upbeat tunes ) than if I just want to listen while on a plane ( a nice mix , perhaps ) . The biggest drawback I 've found w / the player is the battery door comes open at times when the player 's bouncing in my tune belt . Of course , then I have to stop running and mess w / the player to get the battery back in and door closed . It doesn't happen every time I run so I would call this a minor drawback , but annoying nonetheless . The compact size makes up for the inconvenience since it doesn't happen every time I use the player .
  The Panasonic PV-GS80 is a good low end Camcorder , But it 's big brother PV-GS85 is a much better buy . You can take pic 's and save them on a SD card , It has more features than the 80 . Don't buy the 80 , buy the 85
  I gave this GPS navigator to my wife for christmas . We were both pleased with it until it would not find satalites on a very cloudy day . When we pulled the plug from the car outlet the cable 's plug broke off . I notified Garmin and they sent a net cable overnight .
  Solves a problem with older A / V system with only one optical input . The only minor issue is with the quality of the remote
  the item description says this item is by sony , it is indeed not an oem bulb . the bulb i got was defective . it would run for about 2 minutes and the tv would shut off for 30 seconds and repeat . i even tried the suggestions of the previous reviewers and swapped to the oem housing . returned for a refund . the company i got it from had great service , they even paid shipping back . the bulb gets an F but the seller gets an A + for service .
  The Amazon product description is erroneous . This 4-in-1 PC Card adapter for flash memory cards can do Secure Digital ( SD ) , Multimedia Card ( MMC ) , MemoryStick ( MS ) , and the older SmartMedia cards , but not the larger CompactFlash ( CF ) card . I have yet to find a PC Card adapter that can do both SD and CF formats . Otherwise this is a good , solid adapter which turns your flash memory card into an external drive on a laptop PC . Just insert the flash memory card into the adapter , then plug the adapter into your laptop , presto ! the memory card appears in your My Computer or Windows Explorer as an external removable disk , and you can do all the copying and moving you want .
  I bought this to replace the Garmin GPS 10 device that I had for a while and in the manual it disclosed that it ' s mildly radioactive . I threw away that Garmin piece and I hope the Sony GPS isn ' t .
  the tivo wireless adapter was simple to set up . the included quick instructions provided all the info needed . i plugged the wireless unit into the tivo USB port , and it recognized the wireless network router straight away . configuring the network settings on the tivo unit took only a few minutes , and it was up and running . it 's been a snap to connect to the tivo from our home computers to download shows ( using our media access key found on a menu in the tivo settings ) to both PCs and MACs . this makes it very easy to store ( archive ) and watch our favorite shows ( on the computer ) without taking up valuable tivo disk space . plus , no more telephone wire connected to the tivo . the wireless unit is a great product . highly recommended .
  Had this item for 3 days . I went to go listen to music and it sounded as if the music was playing in the distance ! I fumbled around with it for a few minutes turning my iPod up and down along with the device and tried moving the AUX cable around . Nothing changed and then it began to make this annoying buzzing sound ! I know this product is cheap and I guess you get what you pay for . Not worth returning since I will have to pay shipping and handling ! It went into the trash on the third day !
  Product said it contained lightscribe as of yet My software does not find the lightscribe element . everthing else works . Not to happy .
  I should return it now . It is not a ' Zune ' brand plug as pictured . It is a knock off and it did not sync my Zune , nor did it even act as a USB charger . Save your money and get a Microsoft brand Zune cable .
  Product worked for about 30 minutes out of the box . Tried their Customer Support , was routed through voice mail for days . Returned the product finally , next one was DOA . Don't bother .
  first off , it looks really nice and professional . Backlights works great in the dark but doesnt illuminate the hotkeys so thats the first flaw i noticed . Typing with it is horrible , the key are not smooth like most other keyboards . Everytime you type it sounds like a typewriter . Most of the time when i try to type a letter , i always skip letters with this keyboard . Buttons are hard to press .
  I 'm very happy with this system . I spent several days looking at various options both on line and in stores in my area . The cost of this system was more than I would have paid for one of the other " multi-speaker " systems ; however , the main attraction is the technology that allows this system to provide a " simulated " surround sound without having to run wires or mount speakers in the listening area . I also listened to a Yamaha soundbar which sounded great , BUT the subwoofer was extra . For the money the Phillips was better . The system produces full rich sound and the subwoofer gives a hugh bass input to the overall sound . I placed mine behind the TV in a corner . Placement is important . Watching a DVD on the included player , which has an audio track with a wide range .. such as Pirates of the Carribean , amply demonstrates the capabilities of this system . There are many " extras " such as the dock for iPods and the built in equalization curves for different types of audio ( from news to classical to RnB ) The system came about two weeks earlier than I expected with free shipping and was up and running within an hour . Good job by Amazon . The only negative I 've found is with a Phillips TV , the remote controls sometimes turn off the soundbar and TV and other time don't . Requires use of two separate remotes .. but that 's just an inconvience . One other thing . You don't want to sit more than about 15 feet away from the soundbar or you begin to lose the " surround " effect . Bottom line - a great looking system with excellent sound . I 'd buy it again !
  This is the second camera I have purchased from Olympus that has broken down soon after the warranty expired . The camera itself is great for beginers , even if it 's a bit bulky . The quality of the pics is great ! Alas , it saddens me to see the quality of this once great company deteriorate to the point that their products seize to work a few weeks / months after their warranty expires .. Yes , there are lemons out there , but two cameras ? What are the chanses of that ? The first Olympus camera that failed on me was the C4000 , when a week after the warranty expired the flash died on me . At least I got a good year more with that model ( even if I was confined to day shots ) .. now , the 770 has totally died on me .. it seems like the microchip / bar controlling the off playback auto movie modes has malfunctioned on me as it is only turning off and into playback mode ( even on camera / video mode ) .. no use sending it back to the factory as I don't have any warranty and y'all know how much they charge for repairs on digital cameras . So , if you do buy Olympus , get the extended warranty ! Nothing left to use but upgrate .. this time i 'm getting the darn extended warranty .. oh , and yes , I went for the Sony Alpha 100 .. first dive into dSLR .. can't wait to get the lenses this week to test it all out .. more on that later .
  Good product for the price . Easy to use and set the 2 alarms . Bright display and the right size for the nightstand .
  i hooked these speakers up and the shook the place . I am an avid hip-hop rap fan and these are perfect for me . Also i ordered these speakers and they were delivered to me in less than 24hrs and i chose the standard 3-5 day delivery option . ( :
  I bought this product , because it was my first mp3 player , and I wanted an inexpensive one . It worked fine for about a year , then one time when the batteries ran out , it just stopped working , and complety died . Now , with better models with more memory and durbility on the market , I 'd skip over this one .
  I used to buy all my printer ink from Wal Mart . This remanufactured produst is just as good and 25 % of the price ( or less ) . i will be getting all my ink from here from now on !
  It is a good mp3 player but it is not sofisticated . It is very hard or impossible to edit songs and playlist in the device . Also , I can record the voice to the m240 but It won't play at all . every time I tried to replay ends up in crash ! I discovered that it stores the files as WAV format . It plays well if you download the recorded WAV files to the computer . but I don't feel like convert that file back to MP3 and store as an album back to the player .
  I would not recommend this product , I would recommend DiscSavers . DiscSavers are made of the same material but close and lock way better .
  The response is easily adjustable so others can share the mouse and still get the reponse they like . Also , nice to adjust from gaming to fine tuning a web site with just the flick of the wheel . Feels good in the hand , no mouse fatique . As each of my other mice wears out , I 'll replace it with this one !
  I would rate this a zero but there is no option as 1 is the lowest here . This printer lasted 3 weeks before a horrible burning rubber and electrical smell permeated the room and it no longer worked . Of course Best Buy only allows 2 week returns and Samsung makes you ship back to them for a refurbished replacement or refurbish the one you have ! Never again will I buy from this company . I have Canon and HP products that still operate after 4-7 years .
  I like to keep a few flash drives on hand so I can transfer files to friends and not have to worry about getting the drives back . These are perfect for that purpose - they hold plenty of info and are cheap enough to give them away without a second thought . I 'm ordering some more .
  During the Great Wind Storm of ' 08 I was lucky to have an AM radio ( my grandfather 's ) during the 29 hours I was without electricity . My sister who was out for almost three days ( in Columbus ) didn't so as soon as I got power I sent her this . She had power before it arrived but she 'll have it for the next time . I rated it a five but I didn't actually try it . It is a great item to have in case of such an emergency when all other sources of information are gone . Also my radio was a nice companion to have in the silence of the power outage .
  I 've read the reviews thus far here on Amazon , and , surprisingly , agree with all of them . This is a lens of brilliant clarity and quality . It is , in effect , a magnifying glass . It 's easy to screw on and off , and produces amazing results . It effectively extends the Kodak Z740 to about a 530mm focal length . But , it 's not for everyone . If you primarily shoot close range ( less than 200mm ) you don't need this . It will create a tunnel effect for close in shots . You can crop this out using photoshop , but it 's a pain . For shooting at parties , for instance , you probably don't want it , since you will keep taking it off for close shots . However , if you are looking to shoot long range , this is the lens for you . I 've taken portraits at 300 feet . For a man , it 's not particularly heavy or hard to steady hand-held in good light . At about 1/60 of a second or slower , you probably want some additional support ( tripod , monopod , or tabletop , etc . ) . Much , much , better lens than I expected for the money . I rarely take this off now , except for close-up shooting .
  I have a neighbor who couldn't seem to understand how to change the inputs on their TV when trying to watch a movie on their DVD player . Over the years I have gone over to their home countless times to reset their equipment so that they could watch TV . Then I thought about this Harmony remote . I bought it for them for his birthday . I 've had peace ever since . I liked it so much that I got one for myself as well to make it simpler for my wife to watch movies , turn on the home theater receiver etc . This remote is a miracle . The remote , programmed off of my PC , makes everything simple . Push a button and proceed with that activity . Nothing could be simpler . This is a great unit and at a great price .
  I purchased the ReplayTV in the beginning of May , and I 've been in love with it ever since . With all the various options for hookups in the back , it was easy to plug in all of my different video systems ( DVD , video game , etc ) into the unit . I also use it in conjunction with a Dish network Satellite Reciever ( 301 ) and it works flawlessly . The unit is great , and now I can not even bare to sit through a " live " program because I can't fast foward through it , gotta love a DVR . The amount of time that this product saves is fantastic , last week I started watching the Lost season finale at 8:45 ( the show started at 8) and I still finished at 10:00 because I fast forwarded through the commercials . Why this over Tivo ? That 's a hard call . Replay is cheaper for the unit ( monthly fees are the same ) now that Tivo got rid of its rebate . Also , Replay has a built in network port , which means if you have two or more Replays ( or if you 're watching it over the computer ) , shows can transfer much more quickly than Tivo can . Tivo is much more user friendly , so if this is for someone who 's afraid of computers , go Tivo , but if you can log onto a computer and surf the internet , you can definately use this . Overall I 'm very satisfied with this product , and but of course there are things that can be improved , but they are mostly software which can be updated once the unit is bought ( if Replay so chooses ) . The actual box itself seems future-proof to me .
  EXCELLENT LENS SHARP IMAGE SLOW LOAD FOCUS BUT QUALITY MAKES UP FOR THE FOCUS SPEED EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH THE PRICE FOR IMAGE YOU GET AS RESULT
  When I first inquire for my first media player , my IT tech at my office saidIpod Nano is the best . I have download TV shows from Amazon and itunes and was waiting on my computer . Amazon advertised Zune and claims it can view my TV shows on it . So I bought it . No so fast folks . Zune did not recognize the Amazon or the itunes files and a pesty Internet connection error . I have a Dell that is 2 years old with 250 gig hard drive and 2 gigs RAM . So I called the help desk and got the run around . After 2 days I returned it . Next I got Creative Zen , it did not charge up and the device was recognized on my computer . I sent a few emails to customer service and have not received a response . 3 days later , I returned it . Finally I got Ipod Nano , blue and it works ! I charged it up . Load my TV shows and next morning on the train , I watched my shows ! Oh yeah ! The reason I got the Zune and Creative Zen was because of the price . Well to save aggravation and stress I got the Ipod Nano . I love it !
  I recently added both a Netgear wireless router and PC card to my mom 's computer . The router installed quickly and with no problem . The card was a different story . I started the process , followed all the steps and waited . And waited . The install seemed to have stalled , but there were no warnings , no update boxes of any kind . So I restarted the process ; same thing , after a while it just stopped . On a hunch , I hooked the computer back up to the internet using the Ethernet connection and sure enough , this time the install ran like it was in the Indy 500 with no problems . So , even though it seems counterintuitive , when installing this wireless card make sure you 're still hooked up to the internet .
  I bought these for about $ .. a few months ago . I 'm quite happy with them . it 's an even better bargain . The sound is pretty good , and There are a few negatives that people should know about , though : 1 ) Unless you have an audio source with both front and rear outputs , you won't get true surround sound . The " M3D " just ghosts the sound a bit on the rear speakers . If you put the rears right next to fronts , they 'll sound fine . But if you 're expecting a good surround sound package , get something else ( and pay a lot more for it ) . 2 ) The midrange isn't quite as good as I would like ; it can sometimes sound hollow3 ) The sub volume control ( separate from the main volume control , which is on the front right speaker ) is on the rear of the enclosure . I like to adjust the sub volume regularly and it 's a pain to have to reach around the enclosure to do so . True , this system doesn't look nearly as cool as the JBL Creatures , the HK Soundsticks , or those Monsoon flat panel speakers , but they cost a whole lot less and I think they sound far better . If you want something real nice , go for the Logitech z-680s ( which has real surround decoders like Dolby Pro Logic II , Dolby Digital , and DTS ) or the Klipisch ProMedia 5.1 . But those cost at least $ .. But if you want a solid system but can't afford one of those high end systems , you can't do better than these .
  I purchased these as extra beds in my parents Rental . They look great and are not too big for storing . Very nice that they are off the ground , easy to get off and on to . Blow up is simple , quick and quiet . I haven't slept on one yet but have high hopes .
  I love this clock , find it very easy to program . The only drawback I have found is that the LCD display is a little bright for me even in the lowest setting . Do wish it had a battery back-up !
  I just bought this today and used it to record my own music . The sound is impressive , and before today I 'd been using some Sony model my mom paid 40 bucks for , and it wasn't that good . Features a counter , voice activation option ( and within this option there are 2 sound choices ! ) , earphone jack , mic jack ( the mic jack is IMPORTANT . although the sound on this recorder is better than most , you 'll want a microphone . I HIGHLY recommend a Jensen Clip-on mic . They run from 8 to 12 bucks . They are small but they sound incredible . ) This seems pretty sturdy , and so far it hasn't broken .
  Works well , looks good , jus doesn't hold a charge very long .. other than that it is a very good camera ! & again , thanks for the bonus items seller !
  The sleeves are loose ! Its not as secure or tight as you would imagine . One time , the CD almost made it out the window !
  This little camera has taken a lot of great photos for me . The image quality is pretty decent considering its size . The main advantages of buying this camera are : 1 . Its portability . 2 . 3 different shot formats : regular , HD and panoramic ( which in the right situation I find is a must ) . 3 . Very easy to use ! There are a couple of features which I haven't found to be that great though . 1 . The zoom is 2 1/2 . Not altogether useless but not that powerful either . 2 . If you take a lot of different pictures : panoramics , HDs and regular all on the same role prepare to pay a lot to get your film developed . 3 roles 2 25s and a 40 cost me around $ to get developed . So just be prepared . Over all this is a quality camera and well worth the money for anyone looking for a point and shoot .
  Never had a problem with this mouse , only replaced the batteries once ( after 6 months ! ) . The Bluetooth always picks up even from across the room . Highly recommended .
  This product is exactly what it 's advertised as . Sturdy plastic pockets for holding pictures , coupons , or anything else you want to organize in a binder format . They 're working great for me !
  When I bought this it wasn't clear that it was a behind-the-ear type of headphone . Small , lightweight , sound quality good , but incredibly uncomfortable to wear . Ears hurt after a while .
  I read a lot of bluetooth mouse reviews before buying the BTMicro . Every mouse seemed to cause some problem for some person somewhere , so I was nervous . The BTMicro immediately bonded with my Powerbook . If I don't use it for awhile , it disconnects itself to save battery charge , then reconnects if I hit buttons 1 and 3 together . The cradle does not have to be connected to my computer , it can live at home while the mouse goes to work with me . I love the size . It works on many surfaces happily . Great product .
  Bright and durable feeling paper and at a great price . Now , why can't ALL brand name aftermarket products be this much of a bargain ?
  I have the SONY MDR J10 behind the ear earphones which give great sound .. i wanted something with a better ' punch ' .. tried on a friends SkullCandy pair with the built in subwoofer , but the vibrations were irritating .. So decided to for the MDR 150 and these are awesome ! the bass is perfect .. not too much , definitely not less .. i loved listening to my fav hiphop songs but was afraid listening to rock wont be fun , but i was wrong ! you can hear the bass guitar playing so clearly .. the quality is superb ! these are an awesome pair of headphones and surely a steal at a price of around $ 20 .. very comfortable as well .. one star less cause they dont come in several colors :p a white pair wud look cooler !
  I really like this printer : It is very fast and the paper curling problem I worried about is negligible .
  Like many other reviewers , I needed a radio to get a weak FM signal for my NPR station ( in my case , after I moved to a hilly area outside of the town where the broadcast originates ) . My dedicated stereo tuner could not get this , with an * amplified * antenna . I set up the Tivoli with the simple wire antenna included , and bingo - there it was as clear as could be . To be sure it 's only a mono demodulation , but with the excellent speaker design , it 's great sound for the price . This is easily worth the price . One confusing point is a single " Rec " RCA jack , suggesting that this could be connected to a * stereo * ( the instructions term ) - two things wrong with that : ( 1 ) it 's a single jack , so it has to be mono , and ( 2 ) you 'll need to turn down the volume as the radio 's speaker stays on ( which is acknowledged in the directions ) . With these caveats , this is highly recommended .
  Opened up charged overnight , next day went out on ride and 2 hours in my ride it stopped working . Tried re-sets as shown at Garmin web site , but no use it was dead . Next day it was returned .
  I was reluctant to buy it because the reviews about setup were so bad . But I was able to get it going in a few minutes . It works flawlessly . I also bought a Hawking antenna , the best wifi antenna I ever bought . I am able to repeat ANY wifi signal , hook up any standard SMA antenna , WITHOUT access to the original wifi spot hardware or login info . ( .. )
  the fan was a single ball bearing + sleeve bearing , not double ball bearing . fans with sleeve bearings tend to fail much quicker than ball bearing fans .
  The card itself is more or less OK . Works with Windows 2000 and D-Link DI-614 + router . However , the software which comes with the card , AirPlus - to find a network and configure the card is pretty bad . One has to be logged in as an administrator all the time to use it . If you have pre-configured a profile for a particular network ( having logged in as an administrator ) , the card will work when you are logged in as a regular user . However , there is no way to see to which network you are connected , what is the signal strength or if you are connected at all ! This is on top of the fact that the software is shipped on a CD with a virus ( Dropper . Netbuser . A in autorun . exe file ) . Yet the hallmark of D-Link is its tech support : a characteristic combination of incompetence and rudeness . Once you get in through a busy line , as soon as you ask them something they don't know - and they don't know much - they simply hang up . Happened to me 3 times . The supervisor , whose name is Joe , just tries to compensate his lack of knowledge with agressiveness . The bottom line is - why buy D-Link products and suffer if there are excellent products from other companies on the market ?
  I gave this iPOD as a Christmas gift to my boyfriend and he has loved using it . It is the perfect size for him and it is very simple to operate . It didn't come with too many cords which made it less complicated . All we need to learn now is , if we can add more memeory storage to this model . I would highly suggest for all age groups !
  I had thought that the Tungsten line was their top of the line range ( now , it seems they only have three products in PDA form ) . I was wrong . Because of hardware problem , I had to ditch my handy Zire 72S ( sob ) for this machine . I 'm sorry I bought it . Before starting in the rant : the T-E2 is a smart looking machine , it has an MP3 player with a low-end speaker , nonetheless , it has one . The display is sharp , if a bit over-saturated . It has a memory card slot , and about 30 mb of RAM . Now , the tough part . The machine states that it has 29.7 mb of total space . That would seem plenty . But it seems that if you put large apps on it ( DateBk5 or DateBk6 , French / English dictionary , TealPhone , etc . ) that you will find it takes forever sometimes just to switch to another app . This was never the case with my Zire . I have literally thought that the machine was hung on numerous occasions . It is hard to figure out what the pattern is . But I can now no longer count on being able to have instant access to my data . Sometimes , I get an error when switching apps , and have to reset . Why ? To turn on the machine and go straight into the address book , or any of the four buttons , I find that I have to press the button several times ( or maybe I need to wait 15 seconds ) before the display comes on . In STRIP ( the password encryption tool ) , I find that now I can see the screen updates take place . Most all apps seem to behave normally once loaded , but they aren't so snappy as they were in my Zire in operation . I have yet to be able to hotsync to install new software successfully . While it is doing the " clean up " phase , it hangs , and gives me a " reset " dialog box . This is my fourth Palm OS machine , and it has definitely been the rockiest transition to a new machine . I can only hope that I can get used to having lower expectations from this , since I can't afford to buy ANOTHER Palm right now .
  Great product , keeps time , date , and temperature to no fault , and the batteries lasted a full year ! Place on a window with a view towards Colorado for the first setup , afterwards , set there every few months overnight , you 'll like its accuracy . The remote temperature works great for me at about 25 feet .
  Installation should have been straightforward according to the crib sheet . Wasn't thou as printer failed to even get past the initialisation stage without connection to anything but the power cord . Bummer !
  Worked fine for a week then stopped working entirely . Tried multiple outlets and multiple compatible computers . Skip this and spend a few extra bucks on a more reliable brand .
  I bought this radio because my Proton clock radio no longer receives AM stations without unlistenable noise , although clock , FM and other functions are fine . I was very pleased that I am able to get the AM stations I want with acceptable or good sound without having to buy an exterior antenna . FM is even better , even without bothering to attach the included antenna . The other reviewers are correct that setting the alarm , turning it off , sleep option , and other features are unnecessarily complicated , and the manual is poor . I too have been unable to get the RDS to set the clock correctly , but it can be set accurately enough manually . Since the Sangean WR-2 works well for my main purpose , listening to AM stations , usually at night prior to sleep , and if needed I can use the old Proton - with better designed features / operation and adequate sound quality - , should I need a clock radio , I have given it 4 stars . I would recommend it based on the strength of the radio which itself is easy enough to operate , but not to those who primarily need a basic clock radio .
  I went ahead and bought this product even though there was some bad reviews ( more good than bad ) - bad decision . After ensuring everything is hooked up correctly , trying all the tips to eliminate buzzing .. could only get very low volume in the right ear piece and a loud buzzing . Left ear piece worked fine . Will not by Sony wireless earphones again .
  This is a great stylus that actually comes in a few colors . You can secure it to the iPad , which a good , but it dangles . Wish it was a little thicker in size for larger hands . Little pricey . All in all , this was the best stylus out there I 've found !
  I thought this product was so poor , I didn't want to rate it , but you have to place at least 1 star in the rating . I have a set of rabbit ears that get the same signal as the Philips Antenna . I would recommend not buying this product . The rabbit ears on this antenna fell off the platform when you extend them , they are not anchored in . As far as I 'm concerned , Philips just pocketed an easy $ 40 with a poorly designed and poorly constructed pile of junk .
  Just like the other cable I bought , it does not work . I am getting sound but no picture . At least the other cable stated that it is not compatible with the new gen . Itouch . I thought this one would have worked . The charger works well . cpdos
  Great backpack only downside is i wanted a brighter color . this is a great back pack . this is my second one of these . The first one broke soon after receiving the item . ( the beverage holder string ) but amazon replaced with next day shipping . New one o have had nearly 18 months . It is a great backpack . Again the only down side is the fact that i can't get it in any other color . I love all the pockets !
  I have been a fairly serious hobbyist photographer for about a year now , since purchasing my Canon DSLR . Many hours spent researching photography in general and lenses in particular have led me to this lens . From what I 've found online and on Flickr , it doesn't seem to be very well-known , especially compared to this other Sigma lens , which I also considered : Sigma 30mm f / 1.4 EX DC HSM Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras . In other words , this purchase felt more risky to me , but I think it turned out quite well . Pros : - Future-Proof : If you 're considering this lens , you most likely have a " cropped " sensor DSLR . All but the most expensive DSLRs have them . Many new lenses - " DC " lenses for Sigma , " EF-S " lenses for Canon - will ONLY fit on cropped-frame cameras . In the future , if and when full-frame cameras become cheaper and more popular , these lenses might not fit new cameras . This " DG " lens , however , will fit on both cropped - and full-frame cameras ( albeit with different focal length equivalents - it takes wider shots on full-frame ) . - Depth-of-Field : I 'm loving the small DOF on this lens . It 's nice and smooth . - Low-Light Photography : With its large aperture , it 's fast in low light . Quite fun if you 're used to slow zoom lenses ! - Construction : Looks nice , feels nice , and the focus ring has just the right amount of resistance . Cons : - Auto-Focus : The AF could be faster , but that is to be expected without a hypersonic / ultrasonic motor . It also sounds more gravelly than I 'm used to , which is a little unnerving , but it seems fine . I have not seen any AF accuracy problems . Other Considerations : - Size / Weight : It 's hefty , but it 's nothing compared to some of those telephotos out there . Admittedly , that 's an apples-and-oranges comparison , but still . I love the size and weight ; your mileage may vary . - 77mm filter thread size : Again , it 's big . Filters can be expensive . On the other hand , it looks and operates like serious business . - Image Quality : I am very pleased with the quality , but I 'm no studio photographer . I don't take pictures of test charts for fun . Thumbs up !
  This card was recommended by a sales person for a Nikon Coolpix 3100 digital camera . As a trusting fool , I bought this card at the same time as the camera and went on a trip to Yellowstone . After the first day and on a random basis , the camera would not recognize the card . Repeated power cycling of the camera would finally bring the card back to life for a short while then the card would fail again . This problem did not occur with the card that originally came with the camera . I had to make a 165 mile round trip to the nearest large town to buy a Lexar card which is recommended by Nikon . The problem did not occur with the new Lexar card . Fortunately , I was able to recover the pictures on the PNY card .
  I had a printer I needed to connect to and this was great for doing that and the price was great for what I needed it for .
  I have purchased three of the DWL-2700AP . Out of the three I have bought 1 failed within 6 months and Dlink replaced it . Another one failed after 18 months and I am out of luck ( 1 yr warrenty ) . I am currently using the other two but WHEN one of them fail I WILL replace them with a different manufacturer 's AP bridge . They are not worth the high price DLink charges for them .
  I wanted to make movies and I had heard that using my mac , this was possible . I didn't want to dither over what camera to use , so I called my sister and she suggested this model . She teaches photography and video production to adults and she 's used just about every camera known to man . She said that the JVC was cheaper , but wasn't as steady as the TRV350 . I said , " OK " , went to Amazon and put my money down . Two days later , it was resting on my doorstep when I came home from work . I have had a blast making movies of all sorts . It 's true that you have to buy a firewire cord , but it doesn't have to be a " Sony " firewire cord , just firewire ! As a Mac user , the hookup to imovie is seamless . Just plug it in and away you go ! The camera came with a one-hour battery which was fine for awhile , but then I went on Ebay and bought a huge battery for a fine price . Imagine my happiness when my sister gave me a memory stick for Christmas .. I was in hog heaven . Now I don't have to carry my digital camera around or take " freeze frames " from my movies . I give the TRV 350 my unconditional love and approval . If it doesn't do what you want it to , then you probably haven't read the mannual . Hey , I don't blame you , it 's massive ! I read it when I have a question or just get to wondering , " I wonder if I can do that ? " I 've run about 25 cassettes through the camera and am still finding ways to use it in my work ( I 'm a speech therapist ) . Well , that 's my two cents worth ! If you buy one , I hope you enjoy it !
  After reading the reviews , I was a bit leery of purchasing this camera . Because it fit my needs without paying for a lot of features that I didn't need ( memory stick , S-video output , etc . ) , I decided to get one anyway to try it out . The result is that I will keep it . One concern was image quality under low light conditions . It 's OK . The depth of field is not great under low light which might account for reports of fuzzy images , but I found that it did focus on the item of interest pretty well . For low light , regardless of the camera , if you want good images , you should consider supplemental lighting . The night mode works reasonably well . Audio quality is fine . I had no problem at all with picking up sounds and voices from 15-20 feet away without them having to raise their voices . It doesn't have a mic input which wasn't a drawback for my purposes , but is , nevertheless , something that this camera should have . The biggest disapointment , for me , is that the image stabilization is a long way from what my old Sony Handycam was capable of . Even so , it 's adequate for the purposes that I will be using this camera . All in all , this camera will suit most people 's needs .
  This is an awesome MP3 player if you don't want to have to deal with everything iPod / Apple . It would be great if you 're not looking for some ultra-large amount of memory and super-hi-tech features . It 's really easy to use , I didn't even look at any of the manual to figure it out , except when transfering songs to it for the first time . It 's really cute and light and fits very comfortably in your hand . The only thing I can complain about is when it 's charging / plugged into the wall it glows and fades and glows and fades etc . , and when you 're listening to it while it 's plugged in and trying to fall asleep , it gets a bit annoying seeing the blue glow . Other than that , it 's great . :D
  Just plain doesn't work at all . First , it seems the directions for changing the combo are wrong . The screw won't turn as indicated , so the combo can't be changed from 00000 ( unless there is a hidden secret ) . Second , once you plug the connector into the lock ( it goes together very easily ) , it will never unlock . Period . Now , they 've had plenty of time to amend the instructions . I suspect the entire production is defective in design . Let 's see . What 's wrong with this picture . 1 . The combo will always be 00000 . ( That 'll stop a thief ) . 2 . You 'll never be able to unlock the lock . Talk about secure ! At least I tried it before attaching it to the PC ! And Amazon is good about supplying a return postage label . Why are they trying to sell this junk ? I got two different no-brands that are fine , and the name brand is the bad one !
  I just purchased the WG511 wireless card and have had great difficulty installing the card . I have a Compaq notebook computer running Windows XP and using a Netgear MR314 router . The card cannot make a connection with the router . I downloaded the latest drivers to no avail . This card is difficult to use with XP . I previously had a MA401 card and that card stopped working after 6 months . I am very disgusted with netgear products and support service . Service is essential and Netgear is lacking .
  I was debating between the Humax hfa100 and the Samsung sir-t451 , and initially decided on the latter because of brand name recognition and its QAM capability . I was disappointed . Samsung apparently had shipped a product that is not ready for market . The universal remote doesn't work for two listed and different brands of television . One is led to believe that its simply a compatibility problem . However , on the troubleshooting page of the manual it implicates a STB / TV button . No such button exists on the remote control . Hence , even if one can find a " compatible TV " , one cannot use the power button on the remote for the TV . Secondly , according to an illustration in the manual , one is led to believe that different channel types ( air , std , irc , hrc ) can be added to the favorite channels list . But again , this is not the case . One must choose a channel type ( air , std , irc , hrc ) before adding channels via scanning or manually . But as soon as you do this , all previously saved channels are erased . Thus , from a convenience viewpoint , you have to choose from over-the-air ( OTA ) channels or unencrypted digital cable channels , but not both . Unless , of course you are willing to scan 68 channels for OTA , or about 120 channels for cable everytime you want to switch channel types . The scanning takes about 5 minutes each time . Finally , the electronic program guide ( EPG ) does not retrieve program listings during power up of the samsung tuner , but instead waits for your first use of the EPG after power up . This 5 minute scan procedure repeats itself after each power up . The picture and sound quality is excellent . After returning the samsung sir-t451 , I bought the humax hfa100 . The latter works as advertised . Its an excellent product .
  I dont know if the cameras arent consistent or what .. My camera was horrible . Extremely slow from when I pushed the button to take the picture to the actual flash . I could take my hand off the camera and wait around 3 seconds before it would click and flash . Not good for quick photos of the kids ! On the clearest pictures , they werent very focused . My batteries were used up completely in an hour of playing with my camera . Plus , you have to use the batteries to get the pictures to your computer . Im returning my camera and hoping to find something better for the same price .
  I recently inherited my school 's annual staff .. the former adviser left me with a $ 5000 debt and one Nikon D70 that didn't work . I personally own a D50 and have recently upgraded to a D90 . I love my Nikons and have always been loyal to the Nikor / Nikon lens . In order to shoot the " keep your distance " sports ( softball , baseball , etc ) , I had to have a lens that was 1 ) affordable and 2 ) could get me the most distance for my money since my Nikor 70-200mm just did not have the reach I needed to shoot these types of sports . While I have big dreams for a more professional sports lens , this lens performs well-beyond the price tag ! I must admit that I was very leary of the quality it could produce . I shot a tennis match today and was VERY pleased . The lens did everything I needed it to do when I wanted it to do it . I didn't find the lens to be too slow or too bulky . The Nikon lens was MUCH more expensive . You can't beat a Nikor / Nikon lens , but this one certainly gives those of us with " limited funds " a quality option . If you are looking for a less-expensive way to get a quality zoom lens , you can't go wrong with this one-plus you get a macro lens to boot !
  This camera has a great form factor . It 's small , easily clips onto my laptop , comes with a case , a stand , built-in mic , and provides great image quality . The camera installed on my IBM laptop running XP without issue , and works well with Polycom 's PVX software . It 's a great combination !
  No question this product is full on , 5 star material . I received a pair of these phones in 1991 ( maybe 1990 , not sure ) , as a birthday present from my aunt and uncle . Since receiving them , I have taken them with me all over the world . I 've slept with them on my head on 15 hour flights , I have slept with them in my bed , they have been abused and trounced in all kinds of luggage . Not only do these things sound incredible , they obviously hold up VERY well considering the abuse I have heaped upon mine and they are STILL working and sounding perfectly after these EIGHTEEN ( 18 ) years . I am in awe of their .. awesomeness . I have replaced the ear pads once , with these Beyer Dynamic velour pads ( highly recommended btw ) : [ .. ] I 'm 36 years old , and wondering if I will be willing these things to one of my children ? ! :)
  After working for a few months , this miserable device suddenly disappeared from my network . It refused to reinstall . Likewise it would not install on a USB connection . LaCie 's primitive software gave no indication of what the problem was , much less a solution . As a busy professional I had limited time to deal with this unwarranted and inexcusable failure . Despite my request for urgent assistance , LaCie took their sweet time , responded in 2 days with a pro forma and totally useless response that provided ZERO solutions . They simply suggested a USB installation-but their USB driver would not even install-on 2 different computers . By that time I had too many work deadlines to deal with LaCie 's Mickey Mouse excuse for customer support . I simply have had no backup storage for months until I have time to deal with the mess LACIE and their junk equipment caused me . LACIE IS NOT ONLY TOTALLY USELESS , BUT THEY ARE A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND A GREAT WASTE OF TIME . A TOTAL WASTE OF THE PRICE I PAID FOR THIS JUNK . AND THEIR MICKEY MOUSE " TROUBLESHOOTING " IS A TOTAL WASTE OF VALUABLE PROFESSIONAL TIME . Don't trust them with a dime of your money !
  The product arrived on time and works well and so far I have had no problems with printing . ( it 's been about a month now ) The letters are printed evenly without darker parts or shades despite some other ratings i 've read . ( just make sure before you start printing for the first time that the cartridge is shaken . ) I see no difference between this toner and the original HP toner . I am absolutely satisfied with the product and especially happy about the price .
  The images on this product are really terrific , and I did not have to manipulate the photos in any way . It even supported photos loaded onto an old 32MB USB thumbdrive . I selected this Colby model since it was 800x600 resolution , which is double the lower priced photo frame models . The only thing keeping me from giving this product a 5 star rating was that I loaded up one music file , and the speaker every now and then gave a very loud crackling sound . I have not put any videos on the frame yet .
  I love this shaker , with a couple reservations . The little reservation : the earbuds are too big to fit into my kids ears and stay there . I heard a lot of " mom , they won't stay it " and " mom , it fell out " on a long car ride , then I bought them a cheap pair of old fashioned " over the head " earphones and that fixed the issue . The big reservation : It only plays music in MP3 format ! As a non-tech person I didn't know the difference so all my old ITunes wouldn't play . It 's been a pain converting things , and I haven't been successful with all . I bought these for my kids and they love them ! They 're durable , the kids can operate them ( ages 5 and 8) and the colors ( pink and blue ) mean that they always know whose it whose .
  Ordered an inexpensive RCA portable from a different vendor and they sent the Coby CX-38 instead . At first I was upset . Then after running the radio through it 's capabilities , was quite pleased considering the price . It looks good and performs very nicely . Love the plug-in AC power cord as opposed to the bulky AC adapters or cords that need to be forced back into the back of the radio . Nice touch . And amazingly , found some old shaver cords that , with a little creative modification , work in the radio ! So now have extra cords for plugging in the radio in various places . This is a case of shipment error turning out to be very satisfying ! Had I known how nice this radio is , would have ordered it in the first place .
  I plugged the IBM camera into my USB port and installed the software , and .. I could not get an image to appear on the screen . After a couple of hours of trouble-shooting I discovered that this camera is not compatible with all USB ports , so you have to use a different driver which doesn't work as well . Choppy , low-quality video . I strongly discourage anyone from buying this product . FYI , this is not an IBM designed / produced product - they simply put their logo on a no name brand which they clearly should have researched more .
  Great value . Highly adjustable for those whose eyes are practically on the side of their head to those whose eyes are right next to each other . 10x zoom is sufficient , better than 8x , and 12x + would be nice , of course . 25mm lens is a little small for nighttime use as it doesn't capture enough light , but then , they aren't nite vision goggles , either . :) At the same time , anything larger would change the sleek design . Just get ' em . If they aren't good enough , buy another pair and keep these around as backup . If they 're better than you expected .. oh well ..
  I bought these before an antelope hunt in Wyoming . They proved outstanding for seeing detail in long distances . Light enough to not even be a factor if mounted on a harness . The best binocs I have ever owned .
  Very happy with these speakers . Not disappointed at all about not getting Bose . These give great sound .
  Actually as far as a straight-through connection it worked - but there was a fatal flaw . I could not access the configuration page , which meant I could not do the IP assignments , Port Forwarding etc necessary to actually allow it to be useful in my environment . Instead I just got an error message when I tried to access the configuration page . D-Link Tech " Support " was a joke . They were overseas and clueless , and could think of nothing . So they said the unit must be bad , exchange it . I did - same problem . Again the " Support " was clueless . So I finally had to return this for a refund and am now looking elsewhere . I went on the ' Net and found other people with the same problem , also with no solution . Obviously , though , some people have had no problem . So if you buy it you are gambling that a ) it is compatible with your system or b ) you will never have to access the configuration page . Sorry , but that is a roulette game you shouldn't have to play . Avoid this .
  Does anyone know if the Bose Sound Dock works with the I Pod Nano ? I would think so , but want to know for sure before purchasing . Thanks !
  According to Amazon , I purchased mine in August of 2006 . It 's now April of 2011 . The unit is still going strong . I 've had infrequent sustained power outages , but plenty of brief interruptions . Every time , this has dealt with the interruption , even when I had a bit more load than the unit was rated for . Unlike the newer model that replaced this , the fan only kicks in when the unit is running on battery , or during the initial self test . It 's silent when it 's not providing backup power . That 's good reason not to trade a BR1500 in for the BR1500G.I 'm still on the same battery that shipped with this . An authentic APC replacement battery for this is about $ 80 on Amazon , which is about $ 100 cheaper than buying a new unit to replace this . I see no compelling reason to upgrade to the new unit . I can live without the LCD and I 'm disinclined to run additional software , as the LEDs on the front of this unit tell me all I need to know . I definitely don't want more fan noise . I 'm normally a guy who loves to upgrade hardware every year or two , but this unit 's been perfect . I 'll feed it replacement battery packs for as long as they 're available .
  I got the radio ( new ) for the weather alert , alarm clock and flashlight . I didn't expect excellent radio performance . I did , however , expect it to actually work . First off , the quality of the parts are horrible . The switches don't work , you have to jiggle them and then , the radio periodically shuts off . It feels like a short . Great for the " emergency alert " because it may be in " wig out mode " when the weather service sends out the alert , you 'll never get it . At least you won't be disturbed by those pesky weather alerts ! You can really tell they used the cheapest parts available to build this thing . The thin plastic volume knob really demonstrates this . I 'm surprised Midland put their brand name on it in such a pronounced font , if I were them , I 'd be kind of ashamed of this product . As far as the radio itself , I 'm a bit of a radio geek , I own a panasonic RF-2200 , radio shack DX-392 , several antique radios , etc .. I didn't expect this one to even come close to the RF-2200 , but the truth is , it doesn't even come close to a cheap $ 2.00 clock radio or novelty transistor . For AM , it is simply awful . It pulls in some strong local stations but thats about it . I can't speak for the FM , I only listen to one FM station and it 's OK for that . Tuning AM is awkward , it is an analog radio with a digital display . The tuning really needs a fine tuning knob . ( even a cheap clock radio is easier to tune than this thing ) it drifts quite a bit too . Assuming you survive the tornado despite the cheap weather alert failing .. all you really need is the local powerhouse station anyway , I guess . Don't get this if you want a good radio . The weather radio ( when it works .. ) is good . I was able to get more weather stations on this than I did on an SW-100 multiband . Moreover , the weather radio uses PLL circuitry , so , it 's bound to be better . ( again , this depends on whether the thing " feels like " being on ) Battery life .. The manual said to charge it for 12 hours . I did this , in fact , I exceeded 12 hours of charging . This gave me about 1.5 minutes of power .. The flashlight is great , produces more light than I 'd expected .. well .. except that the battery dies immediately . ( even with 12 + hours of charging ) I 'm stuck with it . Can't really afford to buy weather radios all the time . Hoping the switches clean themselves off so that at least I get the alarm to work . I can't say for sure , but I really doubt the thermometer is accurate . The feature set is great , it 's a good concept radio but it would appear to need a lot of refinements in quality . Avoid it if you can .
  got 2 .. one quit last week the other this weekthey were not abused .. only sat in a bag in drawerwhen not in use . the sd cards & micro sd cards are fine .. justwon't read in these adapters any morebig disappointment .. no reason they should not last forever
  This cable stopped working properly after a day of use . Unlike my other RG-6 cables , the pin connector does not stick out passed the screw connector , so it is difficult to get a quality connection on my cable box and television .
  I received this drive a week ago . I set it up and followed the instructions . It does not work . It does not show up under my network or any place else . I reported the problem to Maxtor and after trying a few simple steps , they marked my issue as resolved , when in fact it is not . DO NOT BOTHER WITH BUYING THIS ONE .
  Not only did I run into the same problems that many other did : cryptic manual , poorly fitting stand , and only able to view a limited number of the pictures stored on the memory card , I also experienced frequent picture black-outs or severe fading . By literally tweaking either power plug where it plugged into the frame or the power switch I could get the picture restored , most of the time . When it worked , it was nice enough having a variety of pictures at my desk . But it was also sort of a relief not having to hassle with it to get it work once it died completely .
  I have never been so disappointed with a piece of electronics . This printer will make you pull your hair out . It will mangle your originals , spill ink all over your printouts , and take an eternity to install , all while costing a fortune to keep in ink . The PC faxing software is soewhere in the same genre as the Atari 2600 . Do not buy this printer .
  Set up was not as easy as I would have liked , however , Lacie customer support was surprising accessable by phone . I forgot what good customer support is like , and I didn't have to wait more than 2 minutes for someone to pick up the phone . The drive works great and can easily stream HD content to a media adapter . Not sure why the other reviewer is complaining about the transfer speads . This is the Version 2 with gigbit ethernet . Typical read / write speads over a network which are not going to be as fast as USB or Firewire . Overall an excellent drive for the money .
  I took forever deciding on which burner to buy my 13 year old son . Ichose this one because of the compatibility with my computer and ofcourse the price .. It was easy to install and my computer had noproblem recognizing it . Software was easy to load as well . In notime we were burning CD 's . Our use is mainly for audio and used TDKCD 's with no problem . I would suggest it definitely ! Sound qualityis good too ! I am a novice when it comes to computers and if I caninstall it , so can you !
  Item came in timely fashion but in less then 1yr picture went very dark . Was hard to watch tv . Then while waiting for another bulb from another co . the bulb exploded .
  There has been a lot of negative press about this router . 1 . ) It was probably sent out into the market before it should have . 2 . ) Most of the reviews were done before Netgear had a chance to address critical issues . With the latest firmware upgrade , this is probably one of the most solid routers I have ever owned . I have been a loyal Linksys user for the past 5 + years and the WNR854T is currently better than anything they offer . The coverage is OUTSTANDING ( and it looks great , too ) . My previous router , a Linksys WRT54GX , could barely cover a 3,000sq ft house . With the WNR854T , I get 85-100 % throughout the entire house with the router located in the basement . I am able to stream HD video with ease and I have yet to witness a connection dropout . Netgear has won me over with this product . A +
  Don't buy this if you need to sync your Zune . When connected to the computer you will receive an error message stating a malfunction and windows does not recognize it . This cable will only charge your Zune . Buy only if you need a cheap Zune Charging Cable and don't care about the Sync function .
  We bought this to replace a DVD player and a VCR that were destroyed in a flood . It worked fine for the first 9 months , but since then has gone downhill steadily . While playing a DVD , it will stop as if reading the disk and then jump ahead-and the longer you view the DVD , the more frequent and the longer the interruptions . I 'm very disappointed with this and feel it was a waste of money .
  Read other reviews for an idea of how the product works as intended when new . My problem is that this product just doesn't last . I 've had problems with two of these . The first one failed at the audio output port after a few weeks , where it no longer sent both channels of stereo . And on the other end , exposed cable started to come out of the dock end . So I got another one , and I initially thought I was a happy camper , because the new one 's audio out was solid , and the cord never started coming apart at the dock end . However , after a few months , the plastic on the connector recently came apart . Honestly , I don't know if the competing Monster product ( $U$ be better for me , but it looks like it may be a bit sturdier , and I 'd be a fool to try a third one of these Belkin ones . If it was just one bad adapter , I 'd be reluctant to say anything negative here , but both of the ones I bought turned out to have issues . Perhaps these things all have a working life of a few months , but I doubt it .
  Packaged new , FM tuner and included software works pretty well . The included antenna is a nice touch , but I wish it came with a slightly longer one . Very satisfied with the purchase , USB FM tuners are hard to find .
  I have had this for a couple of years . It went dead after the first year . I held on to it for sentimental reasons . I replaced it with a panasonic , s 25 , it died after a years worth of use . That is it , if it isn't sony or magnavox , I will not be purchasing it . I have wasted over 300 dollars on these two dvd players . That is a 150 dollar a year fee to watch my dvds . If my new magnavox goes bad , then I will heading back to VHS ! This DVD player played great , but then it just went dreadful over night . I tried cleaning it with one of those cleaning discs , but this player won't even read it . It gives me an h05 or h03 error ; I can't tell the difference . I will learn to start doing more research and read more reviews before I keep throwing money down the drain .
  This mount is particularly good , compared to other mounts , because the two screw-tightening mechanisms ( the circular one on the camera mount , and the butterfly-like one on the swivel ) are large and very easy on the hands , making it easy to tighten things .
  Just a warning , it doesn't work with ipod nano at all . I would return it .
  Ideal as just a remote shutter control , or a fully programable timer . Can be set up for just about any situation you are likely to need . I do a lot of time-lapse work , and this is just great for that . You can set the delay time to the start of the first photo , and the time between photos in 1 second increments from 1 second to 99 hours . The number of exposures can be set from 1-99 , or continuous . Using the bulb function , the length of exposure can be set in 1 second increments also . About the only thing I don't like , is that I have been unable to find any commercially made connectors or cords that will allow me to use it with other cameras .
  These are absolutely the best things I have done for myself in a long time . I am a political freak and I can wear these as I move about the house and never miss a thing . The sound is very surround-soundish , almost to a " show-off " extent , which was a pleasant surprise . I cannot praise these enough . I like to watch late TV sometimes in bed and I NEVER have to worry about the volume bothering anybody . They are so comfortable I can wear them as long as I like with no discomfort . In fact , I have forgotten I have them on . I have also been careless with not always putting them in their charging cradle when not in use , but they always work . I don't know how long they can be used un-charged but it 's not been a problem . I love them ! I did find them through Amazon .
  I had seen some blogs where people complained that they had received batteries from suppliers other than Amazon , which were not Nikon , or an incorrect battery . The one I got was IDENTICAL to my original battery that came with the camera .
  type it up , print it out and all you get is a blank label . couldn't see the print
  Does all that it says that it will do and cuts down on keeping the original paper work as now it is in a file on the computer and can be printed out if needed , also like the simple way that it works and does both sides of the paper at the same time .
  This was an inexpensive and terrific add-on for my older PC . I had only 2 USB ports in the back that were hard to reach and I was having to swap out all my various USB devices . Now I have the hub on the corner of my desk so it 's very accessable . I have 1 caution however , because the hub uses 1 USB port to connect , I had a net gain of 3 ports which are already filled . So , you may want to consider a hub with more than 4 ports if you connect a mouse , keyboard , camera , external hard-drive , IPod , printer ( s ) etc .
  I did a lot of research on this tv and finally decided to go with Amazon since they had the best price . I was kind of hesitant because of the cloud issue , but the pros outweighed the cons . The picture quality is awesome . I even liked the speaker sound . I did not need a home theatre system . But it makes the tv sound even better . We just need more HD channels with our cable company . I will give them a couple months . The HD really spoils you . I might have to get satelite . My paper said two man delivery but only one came and he had no problem . He placed the box where I asked him to since I was also waiting on a new tv stand . I would recommend buying this tv from Amazon .
  It didn't take long for this to arrive . The cable works just as I expected it to . I highly recommend it .
  Overall , not a bad product for the price but it is certainly no replacement for the venerable old VCR . We have both the DMR-ES10-S and ES20-S and in head-to-head comparison I believe the ES10-S to be the overall better machine . First , the ES20S has problems not present on the ES-10 . The schedule software seems to prioritize programs by when they were entered , rather than by time . For the following example we are using the Panasonic DVD-RAM disc 's : Let 's say you record the following programs every day : 1 . Murder She Wrote - 1 hour2 . General Hospital - 1 hour3 . Spongebob Squarepants - 30 minutes4 . Ed , Edd & Eddy - 30 minutes5 . Oprah - 1 hourTotal - 4 hours . The ES10S has no problems recording the entire 4 hours in LP mode on a blank disk . The ES20S 's scheduleing software will consider the disk full after the first 2 hours BUT will still show that there is room enough on the disk to get the first 1 hour program THE NEXT DAY ( ignoring the fact that it still has 2 more programs to record that day AND has plenty of blank disk ) . At this point your only option is to turn the machine on and record the rest of the programs manually . As a result , unless your using a blank disc , you cannot set the schedule to get a program overnight and go to bed . I have reported this to Panasonic , even talking to a senior technician but they too seemed confused . Next , the ES20S frequently locks up on finalization ( where the ES10S does not ) regardless of media used . Likes : 1 . Cooling fan . 2 . Digital Video input . 3 . Excellant playback quality in 1,2 and 4 hour modes4 . Fast Record Response time ( ~ 1 second ) 5 . Excellant tape>disc dubbing qualityDislikes : 1 . No ability to store titles ( available in the ES10 ) 2 . Frequent Lock Ups ( ES20 only ) 3 . Schedule problems ( ES20 only ) 4 . Does NOT play through the 75ohm ( CATV ) output . ( ES10 and ES20 )
  The item I recieved doesn't match the picture and doesn't adhear to the windshield . Suction cup is to small and just won't stick .
  First : A rubber leg was missing from the bottom of the unit . Second : There is a LOUD crack ( snap ) when switching imputs . UPDATE ; Snapping was from a cheap receiver . Bought an Onkyo receiver and all the problems stopped ! Switching and fiber optics are perfect . I purchased the 3-Play and the cheap surround system at the same time and didn't realize how cheap the system was . I actually bought another 3-Play for my main system a month later . It solved all my connection woes .
  I bought these as outdoor speakers for our deck . They are well made and sound very good for auxiliary speakers . No problem with installation and I am happy with them . I gave them a 4 star because they are not comparableto my indoor speakers . However , when I crank up the volume they are just fine . Great shipping from Amazonand great price .
  I bought this unit on Thanksgiving Black Friday . I have used it for over 15 trips . I am totally satisfied with the performance of this GPS . I have tried it on different type roads in southen California , and it works great in all situations . Yes , it is just a entry-level GPS ( but don't get this wrong ) , here " entry-level " just means it lacks MP3 , Pictures and Bluetooth functions . It has all essentail features with pre-installed the newest US and Canada Map . Re-calculating route is fast and route-picking is wise . The size and shape make this unit extremely portable , you can simply put it in your T-Shirt porket ( this is important since many cars have been broken for stealing the GSP . Don't forget put the sucktion mount away from the sight of thievies also . ) Touch screen and anti-glare is useful . Just like other reviewers here , I expected there is connectivity kit and desktop software in the original package for updating the Map or customizing the POIs . However , the original package doesn't have those in the box . But it is unfair to blame this for such a low price ( I got it at $ 200 ) . Besides , I think all we only need is a USB cable and SmartST 2006 software in order to achieve the same features of N40i . I have contacted Navman customer service , they told me that the optional connectivity kit will be available at their online store by the end of Jan , 2007 . A neighbor of mine just bought a Garmin StreetPilot c550 for $ 699 ( not include tax yet ) a few days ago . We made a comparison test . We installed two units side by side , during the test drive , I found Navman F20 pick the route smarter than Garmin c550 . Calculating time are almost same . For voice instruction , c550 will tell you the street name for turns which is a great feature , F20 doesn't tell you the street name you are turning to at local but you still can see the next turning street 's name on the screen . F20 will tell you the freeway " exit number " on the freeway instead of the street name ( someone will think this is even better but I still prefer sound out the street name like c550 did ) . While both of units ' voice instruction is very clear enough for me , c550 has much high volume voice than F20 . The volume of F20 is OK for me but I hope it can be as high as c550 . c550 has a better feature than F20 , you can find POIs with detailed info , for example , with a few of touches , you can easily find restaurants or hotel around you with their phone number ( This is a great feature my friend like the most since he is a salesman ) . For F20 , it is only easy to find Parking and Gas Stations with one button touch . F20 also lacks the features like play musics and store pictures and bluetooth for making hands-free calls . c550 does have those extra features . Bottom line , as a basic GPS device , it included the latest GPS technology and update Maps , it is accurate and reliable GPS with much cheaper price than other brands like Garmin an Tomtom . If you are looking for a basic GPS unit not a all-in-one unit , then this is the one I highly recommended . And remember , we should only compare two GPS within same price range .
  Love the headphones . My husband puts them on and can walk around the home and still hear the TV .
  I tried the normal yield , and it 's a pain to change toner all the time . The high yield packaging seems to me the way to go , minimizing the down time . Official Brother toner gives me no problem . We tried reloading these cartridges , and started having problems with several printers . It wasn't worth the discount in printer cost for the time to deal with the problems .
  There are none of the terminals from the picture , in this kit . Would not recommend buying this product ever again .
  ordered this product . looked like what i needed , but it didn't work with my device . I don't know how you would know if it would work or not before you purchase . seems like it should be a simple , universal product .
  The first two sets of these I purchased had no issues . The third set I purchased ( this set ) about a third of the discs did not work and were wasted ! The working discs have worked flawlessly so far , but cannot give a product a higher rating if I feel like it is a gamble to purchase another set out of fear that my next batch of discs may not work .
  JVC is not keeping up with the software . I have updated my computer to windows 2000 , and am unable to use my computer to download the pictures . I have even written to Japan and find JVC does not bother to answer . I went to the store to find out if the most up to date camera is able to be used on windows 2000 , the salesman was very helpful , he had not been aware of the problem and offered to give me a copy of the software if it was compatible with 2000 but , no luck , the software goes only as far as 98 . Apparently the driver is different . JVC Canada could only tell me to go back to windows 98 . That is not good enough . I have been a JVC customer for over 25 years , I have the TV , and VHS from them and this is my third camera from them , but this is the last thing I will ever buy from JVC . What they call customer service , just does not measure up . By the way I love the camera . If it was not for the problem with the support , I would give the camera a rating of 5 stars .
  This is really a small mouse and if you aren't ready for that , get a bigger one . It works great but it is more narrow than I thought .
  Just received this keyboard & mouse combo and have been using it now for several days . KEYBOARD : The shape , placement and feel of the keys is somewhat reminiscent of the old IBM Selectric keyboards ( which I loved ) but I am challenged using it because the Home and End keys are NOT conveniently located , instead , I 'm always hitting the Delete key or the Page Down key . It 's just something I have to get used to , but it 's NOT convenient . A nice thing is that the Delete key is elongated , so you won't miss it . Personally , I think MS should put the Home and End Keys where the Page Up and Page Down keys are and visa versa . The touch and feel of the keys is good and I 'm getting used to the keys being split between left & right hands which is something that I wanted to try thinking it would relieve some stress because my life seems to take place on my computer . The angle of my hands typing on the keyboard is very natural and comfort is far beyond my expectation . I am enjoying learning to use the extra function keys for media . I appreciate the large Space Bar ; it 's short , but deep . One thing is that no matter how wildly you may type , you will not accidentally hit a function key instead of the top level numeric / symbol keys because they are farther away from the standard bank of keys and have softer / smoother edges and are even angled differently than the regular keys . There are two things that I do not like about this keyboard : 1 ) There are no light indicators for Caps Lock & Num Loc . One expects this especially for a keyboard of this high utility and there 's no way to tell unless you start typing , which for passwords is not a good thing . This could be due to the drain on the batteries . 2 ) All the keys on the black portion which comprise all the standard keys , plus the arrow keys , paging keys , and number bank .. they 're all exceedingly cheap looking ; transparent with black tint so you see all their little " stick " places where they 're connected to whatever is beneath them . This is very cheap looking and should have been made a solid color .. Besides this , because of all those little places underneath that you can see , it looks like dust on the tops of the keys . This I find very annoying . Lastly , you can feel the numbers painted onto the keys which is also bothersome and makes me wonder how long they will last before they 're worn or chipped off leaving blank key faces . MOUSE : All the buttons are programmable . I am enjoying the smoothness of the scroll wheel and I like that it also moves side to side , however , I set it to be a double-click when depressed and it 's very difficult to depress and is totally unnatural unlike the rest of the operabilities - it could be because my hand is smaller . I think the mouse is large , yet contours my hand perfectly . The mouse has two extra buttons on the thumb side which are also programmable . The smaller one is a magnifier that really enlarges a square of the text at the location of the cursor which can be very convenient , but I haven't quite figured out how to turn it off ! I do not have a mouse pad and the mouse operates easily without one and is very smooth in feel and to use . With all this functionability , I 'm looking forward to the boasted extended battery life for these components .
  I purchased a used " in new condition " from : tech for less , and was verry unhappy with the product when it arrived . It was used up , not almost new . My tv displayed a message stateing that the lamp was at the end of its life , and needed to be replaced . If you need on of these lamps buy new .
  I received this key guard yesterday and wanted to warn potential buyers so they would not make the same mistake as I did . The protector seems to fit over the keys fine but with excess space between the keyboard protector and the keys . The keys are barely visible because the material used is NOT clear . I cannot recommend this product , it is probably the worst key protector out their . Don't wast your money on this one , pay the extra cash and get something like the the one Apple sells at their store like the Moshi ClearGuard which I had on my last MacBook pro 17 " mid 2009 unibody . This one is going in the trash .. !
  I purchased this book bag for the purposes of carrying medical school books . So far , it has done the job wonderfully . There are just enough pockets to keep things organized yet not too many to lose things in . I enjoy the padded slot in which up to a 15 " ( non-wide ) screen laptop can comfortably fit and the mesh pockets to quickly throw miscellaneous items into . I have used the Targus book bag every day for the past two months and have had no tears or even loose threads . It is a wonderful buy and well worth your money ! More detailed specs include : 1 large , 1 medium , and 1 small compartment with dividing slots in each . Two side pockets with mesh pockets on the outside , comfortable padded shoulder straps and a strap that may be used around the waist ( could have done without but hey it 's an added extra ) . Enjoy this product !
  Gonna make this short and sweet .. don't buy this unit . Only had it for a few months now and it pops up with the No Disc Error .. Great ! Hundreds of dollars down the drain . Nothing you can do when this happens , it 's dead . I 've owned many , many Sony products over the years and they all eventually die prematurely . Maybe it 's my fault for buying their crappy product . Save your money and get another unit . TRUST ME ! Hope this helps , spread the word !
  i bid on and won an item that was advertised as refurbished , but when it came , the item-a magellan maestro 4040 - did not work and it was incomplete . the jack where the power cord connects was missing-it was just a hole in the plastic case and the memory chip which has all the maps and instructions , was missing . i have filed a claim with amazon and am waiting for a refund . iwould NEVER do business with these people again !
  This switch works with my Logitech Cordless ( wireless ) Keyboard and Mouse . I had a belkin switch before but since the Logitech keyboard doesn't have a scroll lock key , I had to buy this new IOGEAR KVM switch . It works perfect because your can use the shift keys and space bar two toggle between machines . Thumbs up for IOGEAR , and it 's inexpensive too !
  In the store I compared this to the 7 " Polaroid PDV-0700 . The screen on the Polaroid can be seen easily from any angle , not so for the Toshiba , which looks black from an angle . But the Polaroid was not in stock , so I bought the Toshiba . At home I put in a DVD and discovered that the spinning of the motor is very loud . It is masked if you turn the volume up loud , but it is far noisier that an Initial DVD player that I also tried out . Based on that alone , I returned it .
  This lens bag is a fine product but don't be fooled into adding it as an accessory to Canon 's 1.4x or 2x extenders . Both of them come with this exact pouch . Amazon should remove this as a " Suggested Accessory " on the web pages for the two products above .
  I have always been an Okidata and HP laser printer owner for over 20 years . After purchasing this Brother ( HL-5250DN ) printer , I 'll be a customer for life ! Very fast startup , quiet , excellent sleep mode , energy efficient , fast first page printing , and excellent overall performance . Basically , this printer performs as you would expect any business class laser printer to perform . I don't think there 's a laser printer on the market that can beat this printer 's price and performance ..
  I never got a reply whether it would fit in my ash tray where there 's a cigarette lighter . Fortunately , I got another connection that 's more open in by the knees of the front passenger . Still my GPS connection is a tight fit in there too . During soft music it turns off sometimes . Fortunately , I have long arms and am able to pull it out and stick it back in . Though a couple times , when I changed from CD to mp3 , it turns on by itself . The quality is not something I was expecting even with the Aureal technology . While driving around some areas , I get some static or some minor signal lessening . It 's almost like the signal needs a bit of a boost . Also , I have to turn up my mp3 player to just about full volume . I haven't had a problem with that draining the battery quickly . I use it about 30 minutes each way on my commute five days a week . Just have to remember to recharge the mp3 player . With the amount of frequent usage I had done , I 've become somewhat tired of the same old tunes ( I have about 15 gigs of songs on it ) . I was seriously considering getting an HD stereo . So , if your somewhat tired of your tunes , you might want to hold off .
  Well I 've read plenty of reviews on this before buying . I know many people have had the problem with the dreaded vibrating buzzing sensation on their headphones but I was hoping I would be lucky and get one without that problem . Unfortunatedly I was wrong = ( I didn't buy from amazon tho , I bought mine from Best Buy first which was at $ 179 then the second time I bought it from newegg at $ 119 . Should have checked amazon first as price was lower . But anyways , once I got these headphones I tried it on and it worked well .. until I started moving my head . Whenever I move my head up or turn to the right side , the left earphone will have a buzzing vibrating sensation . Even with music on it still has that annoying sound / feeling . I returned it back to Best Buy and then bought from newegg . Once I received it , tried it on , and same problem . I gave up after that . Returned it and bought the JVC HA-NC250 from amazon . Much better sound and doesn't have that hissing sound like the NC60 . The hissing sound is very noticeable on the NC60 and it made my ears hurt . It 's absolutely nonexisting on the JVC . There are some pros for the NC60 , it has the over the hear design so it blocks out noise a bit better and overall looks better than the JVC one . Really unfortunate because these were quite comfortable . Good luck to those who are looking / buying this .
  My goal was to find a moderate to low cost portable FM tuner to wear for working out , jogging , walks , office , etc . I evaluated solely on FM reception of two channels of interest , WEMU 89.1 ( jazz and NPR , a very strong signal ) and WUOM 91.7 ( NPR , a moderate signal ) . Ann Arbor sits in a valley and has notoriously poor FM reception . ( Even my high-end receiver with an indoor Terk antenna struggles . ) I tried at least 5 other units within a short period of time of purchasing the SRF-M35 . These units are : RCA RP1667 ( $ 20 ) - MeijerJensen SAB-50 ( $ 25 ) - TargetKoss PP260 ( $ 30 ) - MeijerPanasonic FR-SW200 ( $ 50 ) - MeijerRCA RP1876 ( $ 20 , with cassette ) - WalmartI have little doubt that among the 6 I tried , the SRF-M35 unit is the best with regard to tuning sensitivity . Sound quality was also very good , but of course very much a factor of the strength of signal . I did not expect that the Sony would be my first choice . I thought that there was a good chance Sony was trading on its reputation and name . I was wrong . The Sony was the best of the bunch ( and the list above is in order of my other preferences ) . The SRF-M35 has no mono switch , instead uses a blend-to-mono circuit . This works pretty well on music . However , for talk radio , e.g. NPR ( generally a mono program ) , I would have preferred a mono button to further reduce background noise . The RCA did have a mono switch that I used , and I liked this feature . However , the headphones I use have a mono switch , and this essentially reduces background noise as effectively as if the mono switch on the RCA tuner ( I 'm not sure I understand why , but that 's what I observed . ) You could also get a mono mini-plug converter from radio shack to go on the end of your stereo headphones , although this is less convenient . The Jensen was a very good performer . I disliked its smaller buttons and preferred the one button one preset approach that Sony uses . It also has a bass boost that cannot be disabled . It sounds good on music , but is a little annoying on talk . However , it did hold stations well , was the smallest of the bunch , and has a cool arm-band . If I was a jogger , I might have picked this one instead . The RCA was a good performer as well . See my review of it . Before I tried the Sony , it was my first choice . It didn't hold stations as well as the Sony , and I wish it had a lock button . Also , there is no clock . It was a good performer , and I think I would have been very happy with it . I cannot speak to long-term durability of the Sony , as I 've only had the unit a week . Also , I am less likely to subject it ( or me ) frequently to the rigors of jogging . In short , Sony provided the best in this class . I tried several comparably priced units , and was expecting Sony to be no better than the rest . I was surprised by the improved performance of this unit as compared to its peers . It is slightly more expensive , and in my view , justifiably priced .
  At first i was happy with this camera , perhaps lulled by it 's good looks and small size , then I woke up and realized that half of my pictures were out of focus , even when i allowed for the beep supposedly telling me it is focused , achieved by holding the button half way momentarily before taking the picture . Now it seems there is a glitch in the menus . the other day i watched as it scrolled through all the menu settings as if I were turning the menu knob atop the camera . I wasn't . I don't think it 's worth my time to send it in for repair . I 'll just save for a cannon , I 've read good things .
  I got this keyboard / mouse set for my work machine in 2007 . That 's five years of constant daily use and both keyboard and mouse are still going strong . The print has worn off half the keys so if someone who can't touch-type sits at my desk they 're screwed , but I love this set so much I don't want to replace it unless I have to . Its functionality with my Mac is so perfect and useful . All the other admins in the institute use the slimline Mac keyboards and Mac " magic " mice , and they don't have HALF the functionality that I 've got with mine . Magic my arse ! Work smarter not harder , folks . If anyone has a suggestion for a truly comparable replacement I 'd love to hear it because I could replace it and take the old one home to use with my home machine . Man , I 'd love that . Ima use this set ' til it biodegrades , if I can .
  It holds up with quality . Partnered with the nike pedometer add-on , it has been a good addition to my brother 's workout routine .
  Picked these up for a new system - used them 3 times had to repair them twice - It delayed gigs and nearly spoiled the show . Save your money .
  well .. I have Ipaq 3835 . accessing online through activesync . when host computer is occupied by my wife , I use pocket pc to access online . I figure adding this keyboard will make it easier for chatting . guess what .. since pocket pc port is taken by keyboard there isn't way to make connection to host computer . I know it sounds stupid but it really didn't occur to me before I actually going through connections physically . I thought that I 'm just adding a keyboard but didn't realize I 'm replacing activesync connections for it . Ideal would be , keyboard to have hook up port for activesync and power on the side that it replaces cradle all together ( I might be asking for too much here ) I ended up purchasing compact flash expansion pack and CF modem to accomplish what I initially intended to do ( online chatting on pocket pc with full size keyboard ) about hardware .. it certainly is the best keyboard available today 1/20/03 for ipaq yet I can't say it 's perfect . keyboard really needs to be on a completely flat SOLID surface . if not , keyboard will bounce on every key stroke that you can't read the screen while you type . as far as 3800 series adapter goes .. it 's pain to carry it extra and it 's even more pain trying to plug it into keyboard , but it 's got power connector on the side . if you decide to write pages and pages using the keyboard , you don't have to worry about unplugging the keyboard and charging pocket pc .
  I 've used this USB travel drive for several weeks now for business and personal use and have no complaints at all . I can very quickly back up my entire lap top ( 1.5 GB ) and have room to spare . You don't have to live in a flood zone to benefit from this device . This is an amazing value !
  worked well . pluged it up an had two monitors in no time at all . was yery happy at the ease of use
  Love this for the gym or anytime you 're on the go .. this is just like my son 's and exactly as I expected .. very pleased !
  I was excited when I first saw this product , as it promised to reduce wire mess by connecting my iPod to both my car 's DC source and its cassette adapter through a single cable . As others have stated , the DC adapter works OK , but the pass-through sound is terrible . The built-in amplifier picks up a severe alternator whine off of the DC line and amplifies it , along with the audio from the iPod . Why Belkin didn't include a simple , effective , L-C line filter is beyond me , but its absence renders this product useless . Save your money . By the way , there 's nothing wrong with my car 's wiring system - my late model Volvo V70 T5 Wagon 's radio plays flawlessly and noislessly , even on the AM band , so there 's no reason that Belkin shouldn't have been able to design a suitably quiet product .
  Bluetooth is a very splendid thing ! Now with its exposure of its versatility , this little gadget is just was Bluetooth lovers have been loving for , but didn't know existed ! THE PROS .. 1 . Small and Portable . This adapter is about the size of a large paperclip . It comes with a little cover to protect its connection just in case you need to remove it from your PC sometimes . 2 . Easily recognized . This adapter was found the moment I connected it to my laptop . * I have Windows XP * 3 . Works better than my cell phone 's suite ! For transfering photos , ringtones and MP3s onto my Sony K700i cell , it works faster and better than the actual suite that came with my phone ! 4 . Blue blinking LCD light lets you know that its working . 5 . Allows you to connect to all Bluetooth-enabled electronics . Presently my Palm Pilot and cell phone are recognized and work very well with this Belkin product . NEXT : I 'm going to get a Bluetooth-enabled printer , and I am GOOD to GO->>THE CONS .. 1 . Limited Help manual . The booklet that comes with this product is very small and doesnt include a " How-To-Do " section for what I initially wanted out if it , which is to set up my Networking and use my cell phone as my modem . I am still trying to figure it out . ( SO presently , my phone line 's the only wire I have connected to my lappy ! ) Oh well .. maybe you know how to do it ! But beside that , and until I figure this out , I am very satisfied with everything else I can accomplish nevertheless .
  I bought this DVR a couple years ago . It has been problematic the whole time . It takes forever for the unit to come on . You turn it on and then watch the pretty " Philips " screen for 15 - 30 seconds before it finally comes up and is usable . The unit I have frequently quits responding to the remote and will not turn off . I finally plugged it into a switched outlet so I could turn it off ( count to 5 ) and then back on . The DVD player / recorder tray wouldn't always open so I could get the DVD out and finally it just quite working all together . It wouldn't play or record a DVD . Today the power went out and the stupid thing just reboots over and over . I think maybe the hard drive has completely failed . Other than all of that - it had a good picture and was relatively easy to learn how to use . I 'm not going to replace this unit with another Philips DVR . I 'm going to look for something more reliable that works reliably .
  DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU PLAN TO USE IT FOR GAMING I have had two of these routers thus far . The first one flat out burned up , and the second one is dropping internet connectivity anytime you do anything more than play an online game . If , god forbid , you want to play a game on one machine and surf the net on another , forget it . This router will drop your connection faster than Kim K dropped her second husband . Luckily for me , I have had this router for a few years now , so I am due for an upgrade .
  the ati radeon x800 pro 256mb graphics card is a very good especially if you have been using a weak integrated onboard graphics card that is 64mb . do your self a favor and get a dedicated card that is stronger than a 64mb integrated graphics card like the x800 if you want to be able to watch movies or play some some early 21st century pc games .
  The router is a piece of junk . Cannot sustain heavy loads - constantly reboots itself every two - three minutes . My experience is based on two of these routerts - both of them have shown the same behavior . Also has a bad design - huge green LEDs are annoying and distracting .
  I installed the ink . It never worked correctly and ultimately caused my printer to no longer operate . Be careful with non HP ink . I read this but ignored the warning . Non standard ink worked for me until this purchase . I bought a new printer .
  I bought two of these for my Xoom and EVO . I love it . Showed it to a friend who has an iPhone and iPad , so he bought 3 , one each for his wife and one for a spare . BTW , his wife , also a friend , and I have long fingernails , so that was a plus for us .
  I bought the Teac system that was not remanufactured and was also very disappointed in the quality . The CD player did not even last 6 months ! I would not buy another Teac product .
  I use this bag with my HDR HC7 and it fits perfectly . It has another front pocket that will just fit an extra tape . That is all you will fit in this bag , and that it the purpose I bought it for . Great bag .
  Maybe I just got a lemon , or maybe I 've used it beyond its allotted lifespan ( about four months ! ? ) , but several of the keys keep popping off . I 've tried everything to get them to stick back on , and sometimes I think I 've succeeded . But a few strokes later , off they come again . Really , really annoying . Nevertheless , I 'm ordering another of these miserable things : The design is good , I 's used to it , and maybe next time around I 'll get lucky .
  Definitely a cool effect for your sansa .. really protects the player and screen , and still grants access to all controls and ports . Only downside is it makes the screen hard to see when the sun shines on it , and if you do get scratches on it , they really stand out .. other than that , I have no complaints .
  This CD player has a great weight and feel to it , and it look awsome to . It plays CD 's super and has a very crisp sound . I got this to replace my Sony Discman , and with the replacement , There are some missing features that are hard to live without . This CD Player doesnt have a " resume " function that allows you to pick up off the place on the CD where you left off , and the biggest missing feature is a Battery Indicator , so you have absolutly no idea what condition your batteries are in . I will now be forced to take an extra pair of batteries with me wherever I go in case they go dead on me . But overall , its worth the money , and a good CD player ! You can always trust Koss
  I bought this set at Tokyo airport at cost about US $ 65 . I had tested during the 13 hours trip in air from Tokyo to Chicago . Overall it was comfortable set with decent sound quality . But the Noice cancellating is not very good . There is barely any difference between the Noise cancellation mode on and off . Honesly it might only cancel 30 % of the noise instead of the 75 % labled . Only way I can do was to turn up the volumn to cover the flight noise . You can get the same good sound quality earphone with a fraction of price in US marke which does not have the noise cancellation lable . considering the price i paid , I would rate the deal I have is about 2 stars . But if you can get the price at around $ 30 , I will rate the deal to 3 stars . I had tried the Bose set in the AA 's business class . It was much much better set than this one here . If you really want to use one in airplan . I will recommend trying somthing better .
  I have a DW-U10A & DRU-510A Sony Burner . I get write errors with both of them .. firmware has been upgraded . Changed DMA settings , errors went away but DVD is still not playable . I 've made about a dozen coasters and have contacted Memorex for replacement . I do not have any problems burning regular Memorex DVD-R or DVD + R. . just the printables ones . I had to give it 1 stars because 0 starts is not available .
  I am sure this is a fine product . But not for me . In the manual , it is mentioned that connecting the Visor to the keyboard may be " a little difficult . " It sure was . I tried-literally for hours , and couldn't get it . I called Tech Support , and they were understanding of my trouble , they were not able to help . I was told , " . . . maybe something is wrong with the keyboard or your Visor . " I returned my keyboard .
  weak sound tiny , you get what you pay for . Coby CX-CD377 Micro CD Stereo System with AM / FM Tuner with Digital Display and Line-in Input ( Black )
  I was looking for a sub to hook up in my car that would be able to shake the car but nothing to crazy . I bought 1 sub and have it in a vented box and it hits hard . Now im going to be getting a 12 " BOSS to complete my system . If you are looking for something cheap thats works great , this is the sub that you need .
  Sennheiser PXC 450 headphones are a big disappointment . They are good only when used in a noisy environment but next to unusable in a silent room where one would like to switch off the noise canceling feature to get clearer sound quality . The problem is that whenever the battery is installed the rightmost earphone makes this fast " ticking " sound . It is audible enough to be heard even with the music playing ( with volume level set to low ) . Switching the headphones to the " bypass " mode does not eliminate this " ticking " sound . So I have found that the only way to use these headphones in the silent room is to take off the battery . But it is just too much of a hassle . I have bought a pair of Sennheiser PXC 350 headphones as well that do not have this problem . Would suggest these over PXC 450 anytime . So be aware and test these in a silent room first .
  Speed to receive was as expected . What can I say on an item like this it works .
  This is a lens with extremely sharp optics and a fairly steep learning curve before your able to take advantage of this lens ' sharpness . It does NOT have Image Stabilization ! As a macro , in most lighting conditions you will either have to use a good stable tripod and a slow shutter speed or a high ISO and a shutter speed at or above 500 or a ring flash . It has the sharpest MTF chart ( Higher and straighter ) for any lens Canon sells under 300mm and $ 6999.00 list price . Great lens for relatively still wildlife at medium distances . AF is not fast enough for humming birds and flying insects . I did thorough research on this lens ' limitations and purchased this lens for its optical sharpness for which I gave it is 5 star rating .
  Works great and the price is fantastic . I use this to hook an Apple laptop with DVI-out up to my HDTV and picture looks great . No issues .
  The printer itself seems fairly decent , but the software and drivers are a pile of junk . It took me a long time to set up and i had to install massive suites on each computer . The wireless was flakey at best and the scanning would only work every now and then . It was already going back , but i thought i would try and set it up on my Mac too , dont even bother trying . I did getting the print and scan working on the mac , but not through the drivers / install packages supplied on the website , i had to mess with loads of stuff . Get a brother . I just got othe MFC-490CW and it works a million times better .
  I bought this screen to upgrade from a smaller ( Da-Lite standard 4X3 ) screen . The screen came quickly and without any damage to the screen . It is about the same weight as my Da-Lite 100 " screen , but not as deep ( it doesn't stand out from the wall as much ) . I have found two ripples on the screen ( not too big ) that cause the screen to curve outward on the edges . This ( the curve ) does not affect the picture at all , it is only noticeable when the lights are on . The two ripples ( diagonal from the sides to the bottom ) aren't big , but are at times noticeable during scrolling parts of a show . This shows me that this screen might not be as high a quality Da-Lite , but it 's much cheaper and it works ok for my basement .
  This travel pack is great , the headphones are better than the onesthat came with the zune i bought . thought iam home most of the time when i do listen tomy zune , i do us the charger and USB cord alot . the spittler is great when traveling and wantingto listen with another friend . BUY THIS . IT 'S WORTH MORE THAN YOU 'RE PAYING .
  It really does simulate the surround . I pretty much replaced my messy 5.1 logitech system .
  The radio more than lives up to listed features . Superior reception combined with ease of use makes this unit an outstanding value . Has better reception than many other more expensive radios . Sound is adequate and the TV band really comes in handy . Overall , a great value for the price . It is small enough to take with you on the go but big enough to provide full audio pleasure .
  When I saw the price on this CD player , I thought it was too good to be true . It was . The sound quality is frequently quite poor , especially in the extremes of tenor and bass . As if that wasn't bad enough , it is very unforgiving with respect to tiny dust particles and scratches on your CDs . Almost all my CDs skip frequently using this player , even though NONE of them have ever given me a problem with ANY other player . I have had so many problems with this item that I am now going to have to buy a new boombox .. probably a Sony this time . The bottom line : spend a few extra bucks and get a better model !
  The item arrived with loose wiring in terminal ends . Upon plugging the item in to factory harness it introduced static into the system then promptly shorted out several fuses on the panel this event locted my stereo into a safe protect mode which I had to get unlocked . I do not reccommend this item . Consider replacing your factory unit with aftermarket and doing it the right way before wasting your money here .
  I bought a pair , installed on my car and my kids cant see anything . The viewing angle is terrible , so only an adult can see it if right positioned . More than 10 or 15 degrees and you dont see anything . Waste of money .
  I had a problem with the logitech software , in which the buttons would fail to respond for 10-15 seconds after the mouse went to sleep . Very irritating . After contacting logitech support , they responded that the software was not intended for os X 10.4.8 ( latest version for 2 months now ? ) . Their solution was to not use the software , so no advanced features . The wheel is great , I 'm continuing to use the mouse , but the rest of the buttons are mostly useless . Very disappointing .
  Well constructed and worked right out of the box . We are anxious for more gaming templates . How about templates for MS Flight Simulator and the different planes ?
  good lens for the beginner . Took it to the park to experiment with sports and wildlife photos and was pleased with the results .
  I own this and it clearly an excellent card for the Rebel XTi . Works great , reasonably fast , and if you get a great price , even better !
  I used this player for approximately 30 hours . To get those 30 hours of music , it required at least 12-16 hours of maintenance , research on the web and re-adding files to the player . Though , never mentioned in any documentation I found , the player 's software is extrememly sensitive to the order in which you disconnect the player from your USB port and close the desktop software . This problem eventually locked the player into a mode I can not break it out of . When powered on , the red light never goes off and the player responds to nothing . I 've purchased a new Rio player and love it . I didn't have the patience to make any more of a time investment into a player with minimal funtionality and a limited storage capacity . Sorry , Samsung . PS - I made the mistake of buying this from a retail store instead of Amazon , and they won't help me at all ! Amazon is more reliable for purchase support and rectification of disgruntlement than any other large-scale vendor I 've dealt with .
  These grilles are tough and good looking . The only issue I had was , as noted in a previous review , that the grilles can be quite tight and difficult to remove from the base plate . Rather than cutting the base plate to make it smaller though , I smashed each of the four little " bumps " on the base plate that hold the top grille tightly in place using small vise grips . A simple fix that made all the difference . I would recommend these to anyone and plan to buy more in the future if they are still available .
  We splurged on a $ 20K home theatre bonanza , all of which is pretty awesome except the mx-3000 universal remote . There is a constantly fluctuating variation in the sensitivity and latency of the touch pad . I feel like the biggest sucker in the world sitting here on the sofa having to make 10 attempts at pressing channel " 500 . " After 3 seconds it takes whatever you 've been able to successfully press .. so , a few times is is only " 5 " , then " 50 " , then " 500 " , then " 800 " ( oops , you dropped your finger too close to the 8 ! ) . I promise you , it is the most frustrating , annoying thing you will ever pay $ 1000 for . We are very close to throwing it away and fishing out all the remotes our installers left somewhere in the theatre cabinet .
  I just got this product today and it is heading back to Amazon . I have a Mac Desktop and Windows Laptop and was hoping to use this switch just for video and audio . Unfortunatly it didn't work . From what i can tell , a lot of people have had the same issue . Support was no help , I spoke to them for half an hour , of which 10 minutes was spent trying to spell my last name correctly . Tech support first said Flip does not support Mac products , to which i quoted from the manual * and * the website that it did . They asked for me to send the product to Belkin , wait 10 days for it to be received and then wait 10 days for a new one . This was my first Belkin product and it will be my last .
  I use this with the sony cassette and it works good . I like the volume option on the charger as well . The light at the charger end lets you know that it 's plugged in correctly .
  I bought this bag for a Sony DCR-DVD108 camcorder that I had recently received . The camcorder only took up one of the three compartments in the main compartment ( moveable dividers ) , which left plenty of room for a digital camera , mini-DVDs for recording , battery charger for the camera , power cords for both , and cables for connecting to the computer and TV . I 've taken it camping and other places without any issues . All in all , a great buy .
  I 'm a relative beginner , and so far have found this scope to be great . Previous comments have mentioned flimsy tripod ( almost prevented me from ordering it ) , but I don't find this to be the case . I bought an adapter separately - battery life is OK but not exceptional . Computer occasionally has a glitch when finding objects , otherwise exceptional scope .
  This unit sounds great , but the ipod door is total garbage . A Very POOR design . Mine broke after a few weeks . I called customer service and they promised to call me back ( right ) . I am still waiting for that call . AVOID THIS PIECE OF JUNK . ( why can't I give it 0 stars ? Seems like 1 star is more than it deserves )
  I 'd like to point out to the reviewer who stated " It Ain't that simple to use " two things .. # 1 - the camera is ultra simple to use # 2 - ain't is not a word
  You get audio signal onlt with no picture when you try to capture home movie from comcaorder tape . In very few case , I captured the video footage , but i just get the audio when you paly it back . When you sent the problem to ADS customer service , you get automatical e-mail response said they will respond to your questions ASAP . but , you never get e-mail unless you call them . the phone line is so busy , you wouldn't be so patient .
  After shopping several routers , I decided to take advantage of the newest release ( wireless -n ) and the rebate for this item . The install was quick and easy , although my XP still will not work with the WPA or WEP enabling , so I lock it to the MAC . Stable transmission at max available rate , great reception throughout my house . Worth every penny of the $ 50ish I paid .
  Good performance , easy installation . Documentation is poor but it installs and function without a glitch . The performance is very good .
  Bought it for my canon 5D Mark II + 24-105L lens . Very good quality . Definitely a great buy . Next to buy the CPL .
  we bought this at walmart - I have a new ipod nano , with a metal case ; after reading a previous post , maybe these are different , but anyway .. I can sit it on the dock w / o an adapter , and it works , but there is no support for it , so that wouldn't last long . I called the company to see if there was an adapter , and she said to take it back to the store . I have opted not to bother trying to get a new adapter .
  Lets face it , you 're not buying the Nike + ipod for its stopwatch feature , you 're buying it for all the other wonderful calculations that it can do . After a couple of weeks , the system is pretty much a waste for me . I wear the sensor in a shoe pouch which was designed for the sensor ( Nike will likely never make shoes to fit my 10EE feet ) . I have read reviews that the shoe pouch system works fine . Here are some examples of my results : 80 minute easy run , appx . 6 miles , the system reported that I had run 1.26 miles . 25 minute easy run , appx . 2.5 miles , the system reported that I had run . 21 miles . 2 times around the same track , fast pace , the system reported that I had run . 21 and . 24 KM ( same lane ) . Nike admits that the system can be 10 % off before calibration . I couldn't get it to calibrate because it kept indicating that I had not gone far enough ( although I had ) . On the Nike + ipod forums , I 've seen a good deal of complaining that the system is often off by 20 - 30 % or more , even after calibration . My results seem much worse than average . I 'm used to a good bit of " odd behavior " from electronics and software , so I 'm willing to take a good bit in stride . The Nike + ipod , however , performed far worse than anticipated out of the box . For me , the Nike + ipod is essentially a stopwatch that is linked to my ipod Nano ( which makes it a good deal harder to use than the stopwatch on my wrist ) , that has a nice voice , and will give me feedback as to how much time I 've been running or how much time I have left . Since many of the Nike + ipod website features have to do with the distance sensor ( log your miles , challenge others , etc . ) those features are worthless for me . I 'll still use it until the battery runs out ; why not ? And I 'll be glad to update this review if it starts working better . But so far , I think two stars is generous .
  This subwoofer completes the small system that I have in my office . The bass that I expected for the room size fit perfect . It was very easy to set up and adjust . I have it connected through a HK 3390 stereo receiver , the main speakers that I am using are the klipsch icon wb-14 bookshelf speakers . Audioquest cables are good for a system this small all around clean sound , you can use monster cable but I well just like audioquest . The polk subwoofer adds an honest bass punch that you will need when used with your bookshelf speakers . The room size that the system is in is 12x11 .
  I have owned several pda 's starting with a palm , moving to a handspring and then getting an IPAQ 3955 . I loved the 3955 , but it was SO big . So when the 1910 came out I loved the size and traded in for this one . 3955 had more memory yes , but to tell the truth I have been very happy with the perfomance of the 1910 and am glad I made the switch . THe screen is REALLY NICE.A lot have complained about cases and accessories . ANd yes there hard to come by but they are out there . I bought a very nice case from Krussel for [ .. ] that is leather and has spots for credit cards and SD cards and adds very little to the size which I why I bought it . Also there is a great company called BRANDO out of Hong Kong that has an awesome screen protector for [ .. ] shipped . With it being so new it is only a matter of time till keyboards and other accessories are out . But I highly recommend this product if your out for a Pocket PC that actually fits in your pocket !
  When using my DVD camera I want the best clear picture quality and the Sony-r does that .
  I 've had the camera just about a year - and a great camera it was for the first year . Then .. Almost to the day , I started getting the E18 Error message ( the lens is stuck and won't move in or out - takes 15 minutes every time I turn it on to be able to use it - then it just stops working completely ! ) So , I checked for reviews on line and , surprise , surprise - HUNDREDS of people are reporting this problem but Canon doesn't seem to be doing anything about it . So , no . I won't be buying another Canon product . Not if this is what they 're like . Stay away from this one or you will regret purchasing it .
  Very good picture , comes with charger , litium ion battery , car adapter . However , right hinge cracked after very limited use . Warranty service only available in NY ; thus , you must ship the player back for repair .
  The lens would not switch from auto to manual focus at all . The switch was stuck in the autofocus setting like it was superglued there . I took a couple of test shots and the lens would not focus at all . Everything was blurry even with one subject at five feet . Lens was sent to Canon for repair the same day I received it .
  This printer works great out of the box , but once you 've printed a few hundred pages , every page will contain a light gray background ( toner fog ) . The only solution to this problem - Lexmark customer support , with whom I have become VERY INTIMATE since purchasing this printer , has provided NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE - is to purchase a new toner cartridge , which costs , at minimum , $ 89 . This is what I did - and guess what ? After a few hundred pages with the new cartridge , toner fog on every page again . BUYERS BEWARE : I am not the only person to have experienced this problem with the C530DN . Customers at CNET reviews have complained of the same . This problem would appear to be a DESIGN FLAW with the printer . Clean black-and-white print-outs with this printer will cost you nearly 30 cents apiece . Avoid this printer !
  Remote control buttons are too small and the labels on them are hard to read , but other than that the unit functions quite well . So far I 'm pretty pleased with it .
  I have enjoyed the cable so far . The quality is no different than a cable I purchased for $ 30.00 . The construction is not as finished as the more expensive cable , but it does the job .
  I had high hopes for this product , because a product specialist had bought them and loved them . Unfortunately I did not have the same experience . It was nearly impossible to try the different sizes of the rubber tips - they simply did not fit on the main body of the earphone . I even had my brother try to get them on and he couldn't either . It also did not seem as if any tips fit my ears , though it was hard to tell because I couldn't get them all the way on .
  I have a JVC Everio for around a month now and this battery has worked great so far ! In fact , I 've only charged it once and have used it for probably around two hours of video with no issues at all . It 's obviously heavier than the original battery , but not so heavy that it make the camcorder tilt up when taking video . I recommend it !
  I 've had four IRAM drives for several years . I use a single IRAM drive at work for software development and the other three at home in a RAID configuration .. At home : I ran Windows XP on three IRAM drives in RAID 0 configuration for several years . I booted Windows XP from it . But , since upgrading to Windows 7 , I don't have enough space on the RAID to install Windows 7 onto it , so I just use it for the virtual memory drive and source code folders , database files , etc . I 've had pretty much the same hardware configuration for four years now . It is still leaps and bounds faster than anything else available today . My motherboard is an Intel S5000PSL / SATA with two Xeon Quadcore processors and 4GB ram . There are a lot of videos on YouTube showing the speed and all that . At work : I put my source code onto the single IRAM drive , as well as my MySQL database , and virtual memory ( 2gb ) . From within Visual Studio 2008 ( 2005 was even more drastic ) , I can perform a regex search of entire solution ( 130 + projects ) in a couple seconds . When on a normal hard drive it takes about 45 seconds . I can build the project in about 30 seconds , where a normal hard drive takes about 7 minutes . Accessing the database ( on the IRAM ) from our web project is an even more drastic performance difference . Using an IRAM drive , despite its tiny size can save you , literally , several hours a week . An hour a day if you are building / compiling a lot . I 'm pretty sure the batteries on each of the IRAM drives stopped working a while ago . I don't worry about it , though . I created a Beyond Compare script to mirror sync the the source code and other content from the IRAM drive to a backup location on my normal hard disks . I then used Task Scheduler to run the backup script every 15 minutes . The most I 'd ever lose is 15 minutes worth of work ( assuming the computer 's UPS and the IRAM 's batteries both failed instantly and simultaneously ) . I 've only ever needed to use that backup once . Worked without a problem . The IRAM drives are by far the best technology purchase I 've ever made . I recommend them to everyone ! For more details , feel free to email me at my name at my full name dot com .
  This is a very good lens , but if you don't need the 2.8 speed , for half the money , you can buy the EF-S 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6 USM that offers the same performance and has USM . Both lenses exhibit fringing problems , and the color and contrast are not on par with the " L " class . I own both lenses ( see my lens sharpness comparison test , $U$ between the following Canon lenses : EF-S 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6 USM , EF 24mm f / 2.8 , EF 50mm f / 1.4 USM , EF-S 17-55mm f / 2.8 IS USM , EF 24-70mm f / 2.8L USM ) .
  Although Mitsubish may be ranked highly , they fail miserably in the customer service dept . Light engine went out on TV . It has been four months and still not repaired yet . Over the last three weeks I have called Mitsubishi Consumer Relations 3-4 times a day to try to get an answer . Sometimes they will transfer your call to ' Level 2 ' Consumer Relations , at times they refuse . Their response is always ' part will be shipped in 7-10 business days ' . Four months later it is still the same excuse . Highly disappointed in Mitsubishi . What really upsets me is that the TV is for my elderly mother who is confined to the house and this wonderful product of theirs has been sitting in the living room inoperable for four months . There was no offer to replace the TV . This is how they treat their customers and the elderly . Will never buy Mitsubishi product again . Also , the menu is not user friendly . Sony is much better .
  This lock is absolutely a piece of crap . The lock reset after a few uses and was stuck in my computer . When I called the company , this is what they emailed me : SUGGESTION 1 : Manual DecodingStart with 0000 and sequentially enter combinations until you find the proper combination . Remember to press the silver button after each number change . On average , it takes about 45 minutes to discover the code . While manual decoding may seem to be a time consuming option , it prevents damage to the notebook and allows the user to continue to use the DEFCON CL . SUGGESTION 2 : Sawing off the DEFCON CLUsing a hacksaw with a metal cutting blade , saw through the plastic head and metal post as shown in the picture below . You can then unscrew the portion of the metal post that remains in your computer . I cut the cable with wire cables to make it portable again and then started at 0000 . I finally stumbled upon my code . This lock is crap as is Targus 's costumer service .
  Excellent product , in great shape . I would not hesitate to purchase from this vendor again .
  Our son loves this camera and we do too . The price is amazing ( new priced at $ 10 - $ 15 in the Marketplace or eBay ) , it has auto flash , and easy to download pics to the computer without wasting money on developing . The company did go out of business , but there is an amazing following on the internet and it is easy to find up-to-date software to download pictures ( most of it FREE ) . The quality of the pictures is not great ( outdoor pictures are pretty good ; indoor with flash are over-exposed ) but better than expected for the price . The camera is also powered by a 9v battery so no special digital camera battery needed . I really can't say enough good things about this camera . It is the perfect way to introduce your children to photography without investing a lot of money .
  Let me start by noting that antennas are finnicky devices . What works in one location may not work at all in another location . I am located in a Baltimore suburb 9.2 miles from most of my local broadcasters ' transmitters , and most of these transmitters are within one mile of one another , except for the PBS station which is 180 degrees from the other antennas ( behind me as opposed to in front of me ) but only about 1 mile away . I have been using a Terk HDTVS which has been giving me adequate , though not perfect , results ( still get some dropping out once in a while ) . I also have tried a Terk HDTVLP ( Sharpshooter ) indoor antenna which has given me surprising results : it has difficulty picking up the Baltimore broadcasts but easily picks up the Washington , DC , broadcasts some 50 miles away . Unfortunately , this Terk HDTVO antenna has been the poorest performer of the bunch . I have been able to pick up a few of the Baltimore stations , but not the PBS station that is in the opposite direction but only a mile away , and none of the DC stations when pointed in that direction . All of my DTV channels are broadcast UHF , so I expect my next attempt will be a classic bay antenna such as the Channel Master 4228 . In fact , having experimented with several of these modern style Terk antennas , I 'm not exactly satisfied with any of their results , and I 'd recommend purchasing a classic wire antenna . Do a little research because one size does not fit all when it comes to antennas . There are alot of resources on the web , and here are a couple I recommend : $U$
  I received some defective products but Amazon has a good relationship customer service . I got a replacement right away . I am so satisfied
  I love to make music cds to play in my car or wherever I am . This was a great deal because I also got the white paper sleeves with the order for a very reasonable cost . The cds have been great , no issues and no complaints . Will be purchasing again .
  Received item in reasonable time and was very pleased with it . Much better than the charger that originally came with the camera and very nice priced
  This is the same cheap , low suction , bouncy ( due to the metal bracket flexing ) mount that came new with your Escort detector . The new cups will work marginally better than your old , worn out cups but you will soon come back to your car and find your detector on the floor or dangling from the power cable . Some folks recommend putting your old cups in boiling water for a bit to freshen them up for better grip , but I have not tried it . The Valentine V1 mount is head and shoulders better than this offering from Escort ( as is the V1 detector ) but the 8500 X50 works pretty good and can be found a lot cheaper - but the Escort mount is just terrible . Note that if you buy a replacement suction cup mount direct from Escort or at many other online stores you get the bracket and FOUR new suction cups - so you have spares when the first two quit gripping . This item from Amazon is just the bracket and TWO cups .
  There are plenty of lenghty reviews here . If you have a pod you owe it to the music to give these a try , and then try to stop listening ! Good range , excellent clarity , and very good ambient noise reduction make these by far the best I have tried so far . Now i need to get a pair of 10s to demo . One can only imagine ..
  why pay such a premium for the 512 meg size ? If you use the dollar-per-meg calculation , it 's easy to see why getting two 256 meg cards is a better approach . Not only will you have some change in your pocket but you won't have all your eggs in one digital basket should you lose the card . ( Is that possible ? Ask me ! )
  Use the product within the 30days from when Amazon delivers because I did not and when I finally used it about 45 days after I got it , the fryer did not heat up properly . I have contacted Presto directly ( after Amazon told me I was out of luck with them taking it back or replacing it ) and sending it to Presto may end up costing me more to fix it than I paid for it . Very unhappy with Amazon not being more helpful since I have purchased 100 's of items from them but in their defense I did wait longer than their return policy to find out it was defective .
  I received this MP3 player as a gift last July , and I didn't start using it until last winter . However , within the past few months a significant problem has occured with the headphone jack and the sound quality is terrible now . Apparently this is a widespread problem with this player , and all you have to do is Google " headphone jack Creative Zen Micro " and find the Creative discussion board to read hundreds of complaints about this one problem . To make matters worse , their customer service is practically non-responsive . Do the smart thing and purchase a different MP3 player .
  It 's a gift to a friend . He said it 's enjoyable , but didn't say much . At least I know it was delivered timely .
  Its a nice little tool but you cannot do movements for video work . what i mean is the tripod 's head is very basic and camera movements are not easily obtained . other wise the mini tripod is great for its purpose . Its durable and can hold your digital slr with big lenses with no problem at all . I got it for my t2i , it is perfect for the low angle shooting , i use it only for video work . there is a major missing element and that is the balance indicator . you have to balance the camera visually .
  I sadly bought this without reading any reviews , and sadly I had the same problem . When playing mp3 CD 's the Philips AZ1303 would often stop at certain tracks before or during play , and revert back to track one , then stays idle . After making 3 different CD 's burning at slower speeds to reduce error I realized it was the player not the CD 's , so I decided to send it back to Amazon . New yeah right .. I do have to say that the radio on the player is one of the best I have seen with little or no static even indoors . So if your looking for an expensive radio then this player is right up your alley , but if your looking for an actual CD Radio with MP3-CD Playback , then I would look somewhere else because Philips can't live up to it 's name with this product . AVOID !
  The earphones work exceptionally well for my TV . I wanted some earphones using RF instead of IR as they will function without looking directly at the TV every second . The Sony earphones work as well as I had hoped . I also wear them to exercise at 4:00 AM with the TV on but the sound turned down so I will not disturb my wife .
  This is such an easy unit to navigate through . My only complaint is that it came with a DVD to install the maps and I couldn't use my computer to load it as I only have a CD reader . After borrowing a friends , it is simple . Have used it several times and found roads we didn't even know existed .
  This camera did not work after I charged and inserted the battery . This camera did nothing after I pressed the ON button . It just does not work !
  Tired of camera straps that cut into your neck . Here is a great answer . The strap is soft enough and wide enough to distribute the weight of the camera and it 's comfortable .
  I have more than ten years of experience in publishing and , despite being a big fan of Epson , I think they really dropped the ball on this model . Two factors force me to give one star to this model : a ) The Macintosh software is extremely slow ( even on G5s ) and barely professional : the tools are really low end . I 'm not expecting Photoshop-like tools in a scanning window ( especially with a $ 100 scanner ) but a little more wouldn't have hurt ( rotation utility not available in professional mode ? ) . b ) Vertical Stretch : On every scan I 've done with the V100 , I do get accurate horizontal representation but the vertical representation is always inflated by a few percent . Imagine scanning hundreds of pictures and being forced to modify each one of them manually so that they ' ressemble ' their original representation . A major waste of time . I cannot recommend this scanner . Epson tends to be a good brand but at a higher price point . The V100 only costs $ 100 and you get what you pay for .
  The first thing we need to do is setting DVD player to Progressive scan mode and the second thing is to upgrade cable or satellite TV to HD receiver . Then watching TV is just mind blowing , and I would not even think of going to a theater .
  I purchased two sets of these and they work great . Of course you need to add an amplifier and the wire to get them where you want them . Also a splitter switch to control them separately . For the money they have good sound but then I use them primarily to listen to baseball or for background music when in the pool . Since I am tone-deaf , real music buffs may have a problem with the quality .
  I bought this becuase I thought that ATI made good products . I havnt had too much problems with this card , except that the sound is awful . It makes strange clicks when I change the channel . I have to turn down the volume as low as possible and still hear , because if I turn it up any louder , there would be too much distortion . It 's very annoying .
  Avoid this line of Sony portable CD players - sound is awful . Sony usually provides much better quality .
  I 've had this cd player for two years now ( my dad got it in hong kong for me ) and i must say that it is AMAZING . the only flaw is its lid . the lid is flimsy and bends easily , and if it gets dented , it will come in contact with the cd while playing . otherwise this cd player is worth purchasing .. i can't wait until sony comes out with a different model with a better lid .
  12 + hrs of telephone support over 4 nights to get it to work - turns out the internet port was broken . So much for quality control . Next one worked for 3 months , then died . 4 more hours on with tech support over 2 nights .. they can't diagnose if it 's the access point or the wireless PC card . So , I 'm going to either return it to Linksys if they will refund it , or I 'm going to put it in the middle of the road and watch a bus run over it . The SINGLE worst product and worst company I 've ever had the displeasure of running into . AVOID AT ALL COSTS . You 'll waste more time than you have .
  When this was plugged into my USB port , I could not play music through iTunes or Windows Media Player without the music stopping or ' skipping ' because of the power drain . I have enough RAM and other system resources . This unit probably needs its own power supply . It is absolutely useless to me .
  I purchased these for two reasons : sound quality and their reported ability to stay in while running . Although the sound quality is good and I 'm convinced that no set of ear buds will work in every ear , my chief complaint is with the quality of construction . I ran with these literally four times and took them on two airplane trips . I used them , at most , ten times . One of the ear buds has completely detached from the cord and they are now useless . Less then two months with minimal usage and they 're trash . Seriously , avoid these and look elsewhere .
  I received the skins after approx . a month and they were not the ones shown in each picture with ribs on the sides . I ordered them specifically because of what was shown as I had a black one already and love it . Instead , I got the four skins that fit very loosely , causing the triggers to hang up more than half of the time , the rubber is super thin , and they aren't comfortable to hold . I was told I could mail them back , which would cost as much as I paid for them , and wait another month to possibly get the same thing again , or they would refund 20 % of my payment , or basically $ 1.08 . The customer service dept took about a day to respond and was very courteous , but I have not been happy with any part of the transaction whatsoever .
  Seems like a great lens , no problems indoors or out . I shot about 200 photos so far with zero flare from this lens protector .
  I have a Sony Vaio 17 inch .. i got as a gift from my brother .. but without a bag .. i looked all over for something elegant and sturdy for my prescious Lappy and i got this .. its simply great .. its more then just a case .. got so much room for amlost everything u wanna get to do with it .. is the best for the price .. and the delivery time from Amazon was great .. i got this is just 3 days .. I m so happy .. I strongly recommend this to All 17 inch Laptop users out there .
  Just got this clock and found it super simple to set up-would be able to do it without the manual even . The best part of the clock is the knob to change the alarm settings-all you have to do is turn the knob and scroll the time and you don't have to hurt your fingers pressing a billion times for the right time to come up on the screen . It 's the best when you are trying to set the alarm and you are at that stage where all you want to do is sleep . Get this clock if you want a simple and easy alarm clock that is incredibly easy to use .
  perfectly good sound but I could not get local am channel generally available on other portable radios . Battery pack is a disaster . can't find it anywhere and Radio Shack offered to order one for me for about $ 25 .. for a battery for a $ 100 radio ?
  I purchased the Nikon Coolpix S5 it is a very nice small camera , I loved it , I took about 50 photos with it , then I uploaded it to my computer and noticed there were white spots on the photos , I wrote to Nikon and asked if there was a fix for the problem because I liked the camera so much I wanted to keep it . I did get a very quick email from Nikon telling me that the white spots are normal for small cameras . I have tried 4 other cameras including Cannon and Olympus and even a Nikon model S3 that had no spots . Nikon told me to not use the flash and I shouldn't have the problem . What the real problem is , the Flash is in front of the lens and it is causing some undesired effects with the lens . 6 out of 30 photos taken with the flash had some sort of spots on them you had to look to find them but they are there , I took the camera back , I like to know or hope my photo will be semi ok when I take it .
  I bought a set of these about a year ago , they were ok at first but now they cant hold their charge at all . If you charge these and dont use them continuiously they will discharge on their own ( when not in use ) . The package says not to leave them sitting around discharged , so you cant win . Go with Sony , I bought a set of 2300mAh at the same time last year and they hold their charge great .
  Easy to install . Great image quality . I am using it on a Windows Vista plataform and I didn't find any problem so far . I recommend it .
  Tried to use this adapter to plug a typical flat screen on my laptop ( sony vaio ) . It does not work . The compter will see an external monitor but nothing will appear on that external monitor . If anyone knows what DVI Female To SVGA HD15 Male Video Adapter works please let me know .. Don't waste $ 13 don't buy this !
  I hooked it all up and ran the quickstart software it came with and it worked the first time . i havn't had a problem yet so i can't comment on their custommer service . it has a great set of features for a small price . filtering options to keep your kids of bad sites , firewall and mutch more .
  I am loving this boom box ! The Altec Lansing IM7 . It has a nice deep , rich sound for such a compact unit . I was very impressed with the fullness of the sound quality . I use an Apple iPod , which this accomodates nicely with some adaptors . ( provided in package ) Apparently it will fit other brands or models with the other adaptors provided . I bought the optional shoulder harness by Altec Lansing as well and it was nice to have with the unit for carrying purposes , as the stock hand hold is a little akward to use . It is not the lightest box you will find , but I imagine packing in all that sound does take some equipment with some weight to it . It definately feels sturdy and well made . The only down sides I have noted so far is that it does not have a rechargable battery system . It is capable of using D size batteries ( which will add more weight ) but who likes replacing batteries all the time ? The only other comlpaint would be the base footing is small and makes the unit easy to knock over if you are careless . Overall , I am very impressed with this product and would indeed recommend this system to anyone who loves music .
  I bought this printer two years ago and it seemed noisy and erratic from the beginning . The cartridges seemed to run out very fast and were quite expensive . Now I will be buying a new printer as it has a hardware problem that is not worth fixing . I would recommend spending the extra money for a better printer . You will avoid chasing good money after bad later on .
  I am still working on the features . There 's so many of them ! This was such a great price . It 's fairly easy to read in sunlight which was a big concern for me since it is mounted on my motorcycle . I would also have say its pretty durable since it went flying of my motorcycle and still worked fine . My only complaint so far would be the instructions . More details of how the features work would be helpful .
  The player seems to work only through Sony 's SonicStage music management software , but even that failed to recognize the player . In short : the gizmo looked good , it was even kind of cute , but since I wasn't able to make it work , it is going back to the store . It was supposed to replace my 20BG iPod , which has a nasty tendency to freeze up during workouts . At least Apple 's " pride " can be unlocked with a bit of trying and I can add music through iTunes - which after trying out SonicStage seems like a breath of fresh air .. There must be some better mp3 players out there . Does ANY manufacturer produce an mp3 player ( flash , or HD ) that lasts and doesn't lockup ? Any suggestions ?
  The layout of the AC sockets and connectors along with the overall construction is quite good . I now have two Tripp Lite HT10DBS units in our home . One for the large screen TV & satellite system . The other for my main desktop PC , cable modem , Wi-FI etc . We experienced a lightning hit that came in through the underground Comcast cable line . There was no lightning protection installed on the cable line . The cable company just installs a grounding adapter at the house power box no protection from lighting entering in via the center conductor . The HT10DBS has two independent ports for two lines such as the cable signal , satellite antenna or antenna connection . It also will do Ethernet protection . I have it hooked between my cable modem and the wireless router at my PC .
  i recd the projector in a tmely manner waited for the construction of my media room to be done , then installed the projector on the ceiling , added cables , hung my 99 in screen . I made some adjustments to the projectors image on the screen i.e. focus and inverting the image and hooked up the componet cables to my home theater system , and wow ! it was like i was at the movies .. The picture is great colors are vivid , this is a good choice for movies and having xbox 360 get together with fellas ..
  Outstanding computer for the price . Big time space saver . Great graphics . Fast . Dependable . Only negative is the remote keyboard ( have to replace the battery every month ) . However , if i get too tired of that , i can easily just get another keyboard and plug it in . Not an issue really .
  This is a great gadget . It fits in your pocket and works well . The instructions are out dated but one can get an update from OS .
  Purchased this on February 2 , 2009 from Amazon - great service from Amazon . Received it in two days . Problem # 1 - our studs are 18 inches apart , but the spacing on the wall bracket is only for 16-inch spacing for wall studs . I can only hope that mounting it onto one stud will provide sufficient strength - but I cannot tell because it isn't mounted yet .. Problem # 2 - I own a Vizio VX32L LCD TV . It requires the M8 1.25mm screws to mount to the wall . This size screw is not included in the Peerless kit , and if you buy them at your local hardware store , guess what - the vertical brackets groove isn't big enough to accommodate the screw . So , I 'm pretty much " screwed " . I may try and drill the grooves out a little to give them enough room for the mounting screws , but I 'm not sure if I 'm going to mess with it or not . Be careful - just because it says it is universal does NOT mean it will work with all TV 's .
  I ordered through seller " him_coder " . This seller seems to have good reviews but the product I received did not work . The package looked old and ink may have dried out ?
  love my Cyber Acoustics Monauralheadset / Micophone . they are very light . And they are a good fit for my head . thank you
  I know these were cheap , but with the brand name I expected a little bit more . Poor quality for sure . Not even worth the $ 3 + I paid for them . Just wanted some back-up headphones . I 'd say they only seem like they 'd be worth $ 1.50 at best . Can't believe Maxell would even put their name on them .
  i purchased this camera from COMPUSA under a mail in rebate and was happy to get a deal but its results were just disappointing . the still pictures are not clear at all and the webcam feature is just aweful showing all hazy and grainy pictures due to its 20 fps capability . i earlier had a logitech traveller and this camera doesn't come even close to it .
  Sound quality is great but , THIS PRODUCT WILL NOT CHARGE 4TH GEN . IPOD NANO ! It was advertised that it would charge all dockable iPods . Not true . That is the reason I bought this product . Even on the package it claimed to charge all dockable iPods . I plugged the unit in and The message , " charging is not supported on this device " came up . I had to dig through 5 pages on JBL 's website to find this information . I called JBL and the response I got was " oh well . " JBL has always had great products but I will never buy another one .
  Product works as described .. i mean , it IS just a filter . but i would say it 's durable .. i 've dropped it several times on concrete / wood and it hasn't phased it :)
  This appears to be anodized aluminum . The threads are well cut and it threads onto the lens and filter smoothly with out binding or seizing . It also holds a 77mm lens cap securely . I have this on a Nikkor 50mm / f1.8D and have no obvious vignetting with two standard width B + W filters . Not much more to ask of it .
  i found out that the mp3 starter kit is only for WINDOWS ! So if u r thinking about buying this junk for yur JUICE BOX first check if have a Windows 98 SE , NT , Windows XP or 2000 . ! ALL MAC USERS DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !
  Not worth getting . Low power binocular with an even lower power camera . Everything relies on battery power . I should have heeded the 1 review noting the disapointing product . The technology needs perfecting . Dont waste your money .
  I got this as my first mp3 player , and yes , I 'll admit that it worked beautifuly for the first two weeks , however , with me changing my playlist daily - it didn't work beautifuly for long . It was the second week that the volume buttons began sticking , so I couldn't move the volume up and down . I went to the store , thinking it was a default one , and exchanged it for a new one ( thank god I didn't have to pay ) , and the pattern repeated . I kept using it with stuck volume buttons , but another two weeks later the playback button started to stick and stopped playing at all , in other words , these things have a lifespan of about 2 weeks , it 's cheaper in the end to get a more expensive one .
  I purchased the DVD-RP62 DVD player because of the company 's reputation for quality . After ten months of minimal use , the DVD player became stuck on the " stop " position , with no means to go into the " play " mode . The indication " HO7 " appeared on the screen . From numerous other reviews on Amazon , I have found out that this is a common problem relating to the drive motor . The Panasonic instruction book and website was not helpful . I am very disapointed and will not purchase any additional Panasonic products .
  These speakers are excellent and are exactly what I needed . The hook-ins for computer and other mp3 players makes this speaker set versatile and usable for everyone . Sound quality is pretty good , even the bass , and music sounds crisp . Very pleased .
  It is all you expect it to be , not less not more . Thats about it .
  I bought this camcorder no one can fix it for me the cheapest place was asking for 300 $ for fixxing it even it was small problem before u buy ur thing cheak who is the best for repair after sale
  These speakers are definitely worth the price . I have owned a Creative 5 satellite speakers with base and paid over a hundred dollars for it . It was junk . The base just hummed and the speakers were low quality . For decent quality and power get the Logitech speakers . " These are pretty good speakers , " is all that needs to be said .
  I bought this radio so I could listen to Coast to Coast AM while working overnight . It is highly sensitive to which direction you are turned - the station will quickly fade in and out if you are walking or moving . Overall , not a good value in my opinion .
  Amazon advertised the wrong battery as a spare for the canon d30 that I bought , so I am now stuck with a useless battery
  So far so good . It took me a few days to figure out Linksys connection software and also to figure out why the wireless kept disconnecting . I figured it out ( still don't know what I did ) and haven't had any problems since .
  I purchased three of these units and used them for about 6 months . The WAP200 is not a quality product . There is a firmware bug in the unit that produces a ton of broadcast ping 's throughout the network . After 6 months , Linksys posted a firmware update to address this problem . After attempting to update the firmware on two of my units , neither of them work . After reading the forum postings , it appears that this is a common problem with this model . I called Linksys to troubleshoot the problem on the phone . After 45 minutes I finally spoke to a person on the other side of the planet . They were not helpful at all . After talking on the phone with their technician for 30 minutes , the call was disconnected . I replaced these units with cheap Belkin Wireless G routers and set it to " Access Point " mode . The Belkin units have better range and are far more reliable . The WAP200 is a terrible product .
  Nice setup - works well , only difficulty was entering the encytpion password to match the access point . Seemed to take two or three entries before it remembered it .
  Don't bother using on any computer with windows editions past millenium . Definately will not work with windows 7 . No product support either .
  This tv was the best purchase I have ever made .. I got a really good tv ( brandname ) for an unbelievable GREAT price ! No one could touch this price , I called Best Buy , Curcuit City , HH Gregg and the closest one of the retailers could get is within 300.00 . However , I still had to pay sales tax and figure how I was going to get it home ! Amazon will be the first place I go from now on when purchasing anything . Thanks .
  While the price was not outstanding , it is still cheaper than I could get it at retail . Plus I didn't have to spend $ 2.25 / gallon on gas driving to the office supply to get it . I would purchase it again . I am hesitant to purchase the refills and replace the chip on it . The savings is huge , but I don't want the hassle or the potential damage to the printer .
  Good camera for the price . Major drawback is the lack of an optical zoom . The concept of a digital zoom is worthless and doesn't really provide any advantages I can think of . Of note , this camera also chews up batteries so I would recommend rechargeables .
  I purchased this product ( maybe a slightly older model ) a number of years ago for my computer . During a lightning storm my computer stopped working and when I opened it up the power supply cable had been burned and was melted to the motherboard . Since the surge protector was insured I submitted my claim with pictures and waited , Newpoint sent me back a letter saying they tested my surge protector and it passed their tests , thus they believed it was a prolonged overvoltage that caused my issue . Despite that they were sending me a new surge protector . Fast forward 5 years , the replacement surge protector is now being used on an older TV in my bedroom and during another lightning hits ( different home , different state ) and pop , the TV plugged into the Newpoint is dead . Things plugged into $ 2 surge protectors did just fine , but once again the Newpoint " protected " stuff is dead . I will never buy another Newpoint product again .
  I am far from an experienced consumer with respect to monitors and computers , but I really like my HP monitor . The resolution is fine . Details in photos are clear and accurate . The monitor allows some adjustments to make regarding the picture quality . A key factor for me in purchasing this particular monitor was it 's space saving quality . The base is designed to accept my HP keyboard underneath the monitor , thus saving space on my desk . Also the built in 2 watt speakers eliminate the need for additional speakers on , under or around my desk . The quality and volume are fine for the internet , but you would probably want better speakers if you want to watch videos or do any gaming . Overall I am satisfied with my purchase .
  I purchased a Harmony about five months ago to replace my venerable Proton clock radio . The good news is that Harmony has a great sound that can fill a small room pretty well . A lot of small systems are thin in the bass and treble at low volume ( like when you want to fall asleep to music ) but Harmony sounds rich and full even at very low volume settings . The radio has good FM sensitivty and selectivity with the included diapole . The CD player has a nice feel to the transport and works well . You can play a CD from front to back in order , or use a random play feature , but you can't program tracks . Also , the unit sounds good in stereo mode and gives a good stereo image ( although not as good as separate speakers ) especially if placed across a corner . The small remote also works well . The bad news is that the display is crappy . It is small , as to some features it is so small that I can't imagine why anyone would have desiged them this way . The alarm settings , for example are about 6 points - one half the size of this type - and very hard to read . The display is impossible to read in bright daylight and you cannot tell at a glance what the settings are . On the plus side , it has dual alarms and a good snooze feature . Pictures can be deceiving and I was relieved to see when I opend the package that the unit is very good looking , stylish , and looks like a quality hi fi component . I am happy with the sound and the features . If you are over 40 or wear glasses , think twice about this unit because you will not be able to see the display unless the room is somewhat dim and you will need glasses to set the alarm function or to see the second tier of features .
  * UPDATE * In my last review , I returned the i850 for credit . Two weeks later I found a i860 WHICH IS GREAT ! I 'm glad I returned the i850 . i860 : I highly recommend the i860 with " ContrastPLUS " : " Canon launches the next evolutionary step in digital printing with the introduction of ContrastPLUS , an advanced 5 color ink system . Offering the best of both worlds , the i860 printer delivers exceptional black text quality with a pigment-based black ink . Plus , it provides true 4 color photo printing with a photo black ink for improved image contrast and overall photo sharpness " . I had complained about image contrast and sharpness and not being able to get true RED . The i860 improved these items except I was not able to get a true RED but at least I could get an orangy-red . ALSO , this printer comes with EASY-WEBPRINT . I have been looking for this software for YEARS ! EASY-WebPrint : " automatically analyzes and formats web pages so they will print with full color and WITHOUT TRIMMING OFF THE RIGHT-HAND MARGIN . Thank you Canon !
  Ferrite cores help reduce static noise found in video images and audio offering clean video and audio quality . They also help reduce interference to data and power cables . This is highly recommended when clumping video , audio , data and power cables together . The price is very reasonable . Even though they clamp over , if using on thin cables you may need to use twist ties ( not included but you may find them in a bag of plastic kitchen bags ) to keep them fitted and from sliding on the cables .
  Received the cable on time . The cable work great for company project that I was working on . I will buy again when needed .
  I love these speakers useing them in a home theater system and so far they have not disapionted me . Great for the buck !
  The product is a genuine Sony item but it must have been on the shelf for years because it has lasted less than 6 months after it was installed and the TV is only used on weekend which is about 300 hours .
  I have owned Canon products for years . I have bought 5 DSLR cameras ( sold 2 after about a year ) and found them to be excellent . Now I know that this is an inexpensive consumer color printer but the photo quality is just poor . There is no nice way to put it . The skin tones appear washed out , in fact , all colors appear to be washed out . I 'm using Canon paper and I 've calibrated my monitor . I guess you get what you pay for but I really expected higher quality from Canon . Color documents are fine .
  Reviewed with the SanDisk extreme II 2.0 GB SD memory card ( optional ) installed . Over twice as fast as the SD20 ultra compact . This camera embodies a range of features enabled by emerging computational technology . I read the previous reviews before purchasing the SD900 . Every problem discussed apparently was a problem with the user not reading the manual . This camera can run in dark , silent mode ( without LCD screen and without sounds providing feedback ) . As is said , " perfection is undefined for complex adaptive systems " . In problem domains that are complicated and constantly changing , perfection has no meaning : instead of perfection , seek improvement . Canon has with this camera . THe features offered and the image quality are extraordinary . Assuming you want a light , low profile , reliable camera for capturing , in high quality , interesting images as they appear in your life .
  This is an update to my earlier review below . I 've since had two of these cards go bad on me , causing spontaneous reboots and lock-ups on booting ( the only problems I 've ever had with this ThinkPad running Windows XP ! ) . I 've tried the cards in two different laptops ( one a Gateway , one an IBM ) and the bad cards ( I also have a good one ) cause the same problems in both laptops , so it 's definitely a problem with the cards , not the computer . D-Link replaced the first one ( though it took about a month to get it , even with cross-shipping ) and now I have to deal with them again to get this one replaced . It 's a great card when it works , but I definitely will not be buying another one . From what I 've read here in the reviews , these problems aren't uncommon , and may be a heat-related issue . Beware ! Original review : I can't imagine much has changed in the week and a half since somebody complained about this card not working with XP , but be that as it may , it worked fine for me ! There most certainly * are * XP drivers for the 650 + on the D-Link website ( Perhaps you need to look a little more carefully .. ? I admit the D-Link site isn't obvious to navigate , but c'mon-it 's not rocket science ! ) and they work perfectly . I got two of these , put them on two different laptops running XP and set up a peer-to-peer network using one of them as a router to my cable modem , all in less than half an hour , and I 've never had any experience with wireless networking before , just regular Ethernet . It 's easy , very fast , and the range seems pretty decent for just doing peer-to-peer . I 'm happy with it , XP and all .
  the description given is a lie . It was missing the legs for the standing speakers and the mini sound bar . the seller barely responds to any emails sent . I sent the item back and we agreed on a certain amount for the refund yet he about forever to pay back the money .
  The picture is clearly a " lime green " or " light green " cable what you get is a ugly dark green . Beware This Is Not the product you will get , they really need to correct this picture .
  Only problem I have is copying and printing transparencies . I am an artist and have my work photographed on 8 x 10 transparencies ( chromes ) . I was told that this machine can copy same by simply putting a white piece of paper over the back of the transparency . IT DOES NOT WORK and I can't seem to get an answer from anyone regarding this problem . Other than the above , I am satisfied with the machine .
  The first thing I noticed upon receiving these cables ( I ordered quite a few , in different sizes ) is that they are packaged in individual ziplock bags , rather than bound by twist-ties like so many other cables . I 'm not exactly sure why , but this left me with a positive impression . Getting the cables out of their pouches , they appear to be high quality , better than others I 've purchased online in the past . The variety of sizes is definitely a plus . I 'd definitely order more from Tripp Lite if need more patch cables .
  These pouches are perfect for laminating documents , handouts and just about anything I like to protect or have a heavier weight than the weight of paper . It works well for all my projects . I love it .
  very disappointed .. the cd tray broke within the 1st month of use & Amazon . com was no help in getting it fixed ..
  I bought these for use with my HP DVD740e Lightscribe DVD burner . The device would not write to them . Not one of them ! I have never had this problem when using similar blanks with HP and Verbatim labels . The Memorex blanks I had were made by CMC Magnetics . What a waste . FYI - Windows users can get a small - but distinct - increase in label darkness with the use of a free utility found on LightScribe 's site . It increases the contrast . " Best " quality labels do take longer to create . I guess Amazon does not allow web addresses . If you want the utility , search for " Lightscribe Exstended Label Contrast Utility " without the quotes . Or you can take a big guess at the name of a commercial site devoted to LightScribe .
  Typically excellent Tele Vue eyepiece for a good ( Amazon ! ) price . I use it on a Celestron 200 mm telescope and am very happy with field sharpness & eye relief .
  This is a great little dock . I have it hooked up to the PC with the USB cable that came with my first generation 30GB Zune . Zune fits nicely in the cradle . Great find . Highly recommended .
  Great price on a great flash card . I needed ONE more flash card so I could stop juggling the flash cards I already have between devices every few days .. ( Kodak DC4800 camera , HP Handheld computer , DC50 , etc . ) Especially when traveling , I take LOTS of pictures and adding this card to my electronics arsenal means I can snap longer before downloading onto my 6-gigabyte digital wallet storage device . Shooting highest-resolution pics is less trouble with this high-capacity card when compared to smaller-capacity ones since this card doesn't fill-up so quickly . And storing files ( images , audio , documents , etc . ) for my handheld computer is easier and more fun , too . And this card is NOT SLOWER than others I have . My devices seem to read / write to this card at the same speed as my other CF cards .
  If you are running short of USB ports , this is just the perfect expansion . I just plugged it in and it game me 3 additional usb ports . I had absolutely no problems . If this is exactly what you need , why look any further .
  This thing is just one of the worst pieces of product design ever . The Ethernet connector connects to , essentially a tiny little flap door that was engineered by a crazy person . The slightest touch and it breaks off , at which point the entire adaptor is rendered useless . AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE !
  I have a trendnet wireless router and like it . figurd this would be similar features minus WIFI . it was so wrong . the filtering options on this are the worst Ive ever seen . This is pathetic . i am a network administrator and planned to use this as a simple gateway for a wireless camera system that has its own RF receiver . Really useless . Ended up getting an old Linksys router and disabling wifi and installing DD-WRT .
  I have been a Canon fan ever since I purchased my Canon AE-1 back in 1981 . Although that camera was fantastic for its time , this EOS 30D is the new standard by which all cameras within the reach of the general public should be judged . If you purchase an " L " Series lens with it , you 'll be absolutely floored by the quality of the images you can produce . For people who have only used point-and-shoot cameras , this camera may at first seem a bit large , but trust me , you will immediately find this to be an advantage in terms of the stability you gain by having more surface area to hold . It feels like a glove . Once you get used to it , holding your point-and-shoot will feel quite awkward . The camera encompasses such a broad range of creative control that the absolute novice can take it right out of the box and start photographing in 5 minutes ( don't forget to buy a compact flash card since one is not provided by Canon ) . The possibilities of creative potential offered by this camera are only limited by your skill and creativity as a photographer / Photoshop user . My recommendation to people buying a digital camera of this calliber for the first time is to also purchase a book specific to this particular camera to learn its features in depth . One book I highly recommend is ' Canon EOS 30D Guide to Digital SLR Photography ' by David D. Busch published by Thomson Course Technology PTR .
  It is a shame that Intel continues the " Wintel " ( Windows + Intel ) legacy of releasing drivers for their hardware for windows only . I tried this card on a Thinkpad T40 , on which I installed SUSE LINUX PRO v9.0 . It turns out that Intel has not developed ( nor they seem to be planning to ) linux drivers for this card . Hopefully I was able to return the Intel WLAN card , and I 'm currently using a Orinoco dual-wlan ( 802.11a / 802.11b ) card on the Thinkpad 's Cardbus slot . Unlike the Intel " solution " the Orinoco works beatifully . Until Intel stops meaning " wintel " , avoid this card , unless you use WinXP , which is apparently what Intel wants you to do , along with Microsoft . That some companies would use their market domination to prevent competition and letting the users run alternative operating systems is a shame . Hopefully other vendors of Wireless lan cards ( see above ) are fully supporting Linux .
  The receiver is the best performing for the price , and has a ton of " future proofing " features .
  I bought this tv at a store called AmazingSavings ( fomally OddJobs ) it was priced for $ 199.99 . i thought it was a great price for a flat screen , so I went price shopping , most 27 " flat screens where in the $ 220-$500 mark . So i went back to the store and bought it . The picture quality was great , for the first couple days . and on channels with a marquee ( Fox News , CNN ) the letters that are scrolling seem to get thin when they reach the middle and then real fat when it gets to the end . and now after 1 day it would start to " blink " going off and on real fast . and now it 's REALLY blurry , i don't know if it 's defective , but if if is defective the picture quality when it was working right , was really good !
  power up ago-go .. AA + Apple iPod USB Travel Kit with Car Charger , Travel Adapter & Cable . cant beat for the price !
  I am disappointed with my TARGUS Universal Wireless Keyboard . Targus cursor control on keyboard takes the form of a mouse like pad . Good idea except , mouse pad does not work with Tungsten E and from what I understand with ZIRE . You have to always take yours hands off keyboard and pick up stylus . You will only find out about this out not in Manual , not on website but hidden in install readme . file which says " On PALM Tungsten and ZIRE PDA 's , the mouse pointer feature is not supported " . In fact their website is misleading because says compatible with Palm . It is very frustrating having to always take your hand off keyboard to control cursor . Manual is poor still trying to find info about built in function keys along right side . Downloaded latest Driver , still not work . Guess TARGUS does not want business of Tungsten and ZIRE owners , very strange with all other PDAs supported they choose to not provide such a important feature . Do not recommend for Tungsten or ZIRE PDA
  We love our fire pit ! We use it about once a week . It is so relaxing to sit out and watch the fire with no worries of escaping flames . When done , we can put the mesh top on and head inside . No more dragging out the hose !
  It seems like a lie but until now Creative doesn't have created any equipment support for this model . In Windows 2k as in 98 when I open the tray .. it opens but in a few seconds it closesalone .. incredible . Absurditly it does not even have a pattern of time to close , so you need to pray for , when you put or take the cd . When I bought it ; I put 100 dlls to the trash can .
  I purchased my first dSLR camera approx . 6 months ago ( Canon XSI ) . It came with a standard 18-55 lens which also works great , but I wanted some specifically for taking pictures of people that would create a nice blurred background ( bokeh ) . My friend suggested I purchase this . I did and I was not disappointed ! I was so impressed with the quality of the pictures-sharp , with great bokeh ( when pics are shot wide open aka wide aperture ) . I agree with other reviews regarding the ' quality ' of the construction of the lens . I currently do not own any of the more expensive Canon lenses , but believe this is a great lens for someone who is just getting into photography ! I would highly recommend it !
  I bought the Bose Acoustimass 5 for a friend in Korea to use in his flat screen TV . Once we set it up the sound transformation was phenomenal-it immediately gave the small room a big arena quality to it . Now I have his friends asking me when I am coming back to Korea so I can bring back another one ( these are terribly expensive in Korea , btw ) .
  You will not imagine it works , and stay on the dash board . But it stays . The designer is smart . Such a small thing , solves a big problem . I never see a product so many people praise .
  I don't know why so many people expect this camera to be like an HD camera or something . It 's cheap , small , and just plain FUN ! I make all of my youtube videos with this camera . If you turn on a lamp .. it helps a lot ! I highly recommend this for someone looking for something quick & easy !
  When I popped the thing into my cassette player ( ' 97 Chevy Monte Carlo ) , it refused to stay in ! The player kept ejecting it , and after about ( literally ) 20 tries it finally stayed in and cracking noise others talked about was so bad . That doesn't really matter though , since when I plugged it into my ipod a message came up : " device not compatible . " And then if you want to return it , you have to pay return shipping . Is it worth it since I paid so little for this piece of junk ? Also , it wasn't until after all of this mess that I went on Griffin 's website to see that the item has been DISCONTINUED . Hmm .. I wonder why ..
  I have a BIG computer and this thing has a lot of room to spare ! It really will hold almost any computer . It has more pockets than you know what to do with ! Material is fairly durable and will hold up against even some serious abuse . I have loaded 40 lbs worth of stuff into it and it has held up nicely !
  The player works fine with any DVD . Nevertheless after a while , I mean a month or two you start noticing that while playing DVDs the images get stuck and it doesn't play anymore . The tray doesn't open and you have to unplug it so you can get the disc out , besides the upper part of the player gets hot and you can't play anything and you have to wait a lot if you want to use it again . It is a pain in the neck . Sure you get what you paid for , not exactly a great product . If you are desperate and need a DVD player just for the while buy it NONTHELESS , don't think about it . It 's not worth it .
  Water built up inside the unit till the screen was obscured and then damaged , electronics eventually failed also causing it to cycle on its own . Happened slow enough that warranty expired before it was noticeable . Who builds a watering timer that isn't waterproof ? .
  This frame is easy to use and the pictures look fantastic ! I have received many compliments on it and have only had it for about a month . I highly recommend this frame .
  The item is exactly what I needed for my printer and arrived very quickly . Usually the carts aren't sold seperately any more so this was a great find .
  We needed a storage alternative for CDs since our infant started clearing out the CD shelf . Got rid of all jewel cases . This holds A LOT of CDs , plus booklets / covers . Since we 'll be moving across oceans soon , it 's a great way to save space , as well . Sturdy , easy to handle . Seemed to be the cheapest option , as well .
  I was given the Sony ICF-112 clock radio . I thought the BEEP-BEEP alarm was too quiet to wake me . I 'm donating it since setting the time is such a hastle . I went online to get a MSRP price for it .. $ 50.00 ! Please ! It has one speaker , only one alarm setting , no volume control on the buzzer and is not all that compact ! Outside of Amazon , I found this alarm for $ 15.00 - I am still trying to figure why anyone would be happy with this alarm clock for $ 49.95 .
  if you are deciding between this and the new bose , and youve listened to the bose , get the bose . these are cheaper , but not nearly as good on either noise canceling or on sound quality . the bose are worth it . these arent worth what you pay .
  This is the most convenient case for a " point and shoot " digital camera I have owned , and I have owned several . It fits easily over my belt . It 's soft , easy to access , and gentle on the equipment . I carry a Pentax Optio S1 in it every day .
  Bought this frame today and took it out of the box to put it through its paces . Nothing worked . The USB device is not recognized . Gave up on that , tried loading photos from a CF card . It refused to recognize the format . Okay , I reformatted the card in Windows , still didn't recognize the card . Then I resized all my photos because it didn't recognize the . jpg format , but even that didn't help . I give up , not one thing that I tried worked . Just about the worst product I have ever seen . Glad I didn't bother with the nonexistent " customer service " as some other poor people have . This is going back to the store tomorrow . Wish I could give this product -0 star since it costs me gas to return it .
  Item was shipped so quick-and it was exactly a it stated and works wonderfully with my computor . Would purchase items from this company anytime .
  I used the 2GB SanDisk in my PSP and I can fit 4-5 Full Length Movies on it and the playback is great .
  screen protector gets scratched on the inside while inserting ipod , inserting ipod is very difficult to do and likewise takes the jaws of life to remove ipod .. also for some reason ipod battery gets drained easily with this thing on .
  Hooked my laptop up to my tv since my screen went out . Now I still have a functioning computer and all I had to buy was this cable .
  I ordered this item 9/05 and waited a week for it to arrive . Then I got a notice from amazon that I had refused the shipment and was being issued a credit . When I finally tracked someone down at Dynadirect they stated that the item was no longer carried . It would have been nice to know that before ordering ! The Charger may be fine but getting it via Amazon is not !
  My electrician tried to install and one speaker slipped off from his hand & was dropped on the wood floor , but the speaker broke in half . It is just too fragile .
  Add my voice to the throng of unsatisfied customers who own this one . The features are great , the print quality 's great , but once the paper stops feeding except manually a sheet at a time ( and even then only after several attempts and paper jams ) , you 're hosed . Look elsewhere .
  Within a day of owning this product , one of the joints near the base cracked , preventing the leg from securely attaching to the joint . Like others have mentioned as well , it 's rather difficult to position the pod with a dslr mounted in positions they 've advertised .
  Unlike several of the other reviews , I 'd characterize the setup as very straight foward if you 're familiar with WiFi networks . My first and only obstacle - the deal breaker - came when configuring my playlists . Even though the playlists are those available to the host computer , it will not see networked drives . I must be assuming , incorrectly , that I 'm in the majority in placing the many gigabytes of MP3s , JPGs , and other media files on a network server instead of a local hard drive . When I try to add a locally mapped drive , which is already available on the host computer , to the media play list , it simply will not accept it . A quick call to Linksys support confirms this . They suggested that I copy my files to the local drive and then add them to the media play list . In between chuckles I noted that it was impractical and I had no intention of moving 15 + GBs of storage to individual local hard drives when these files were already accessible to every node on the network ( accept the WMA11B ) from their file server storage location . Until a media adapter supports something as simple as a network drive or share , it will not be of any use to me .
  Just to be clear , customer service and tech service are suppose to assist with answers on questions you may have regarding products they carry . So I thought ! I called the 888-888-2087 number to get information on a handset and customer service had no idea how to look up on the part they are selling on Amazon , then he transfers me to tech service , and I explain to him that prior to purchasing a handset they carry , I 'd like to know if it would be compatible with our panasonic answering system I have . He interupts and says how am I suppose to know that ! Unreal , how is he suppose to know that ? well I would assume they sell a product and would be familiar with what they carry . Apparently not .
  I would give this leather case a big fat zero if Amazon allowed it . My first problem is that the darned thing doesn't stay closed . There is no clasp , button , zipper - not anything . I have to put a rubber band around it to keep it closed which just looks tacky . Second , the adhesive velcro strips that you have to put on the back of your Jornada get in the way when you place it in the docking cradle . Of course , you could just put one velcro strip on the top but then it doesn't feel like it is secure enough in the leather case . I felt that it wouldn't take too much for the Jornada to fall out . Maybe it wouldn't but I am not trusting my expensive PDA to one little velcro strip . Also , when placing the velcro strip in the right place on the top it covers the reset button . I moved the strip over so the reset button wouldn't be covered but I would have thought that HP would have considered this when designing the case . So my advice to you is to avoid this case at all costs and look elsewhere when looking for a case to protect your Jornada .
  Not sure what these folks are complaining about .. I use mine on a 3rd generation iPod and the bass sounds great . But let 's be clear , the frequency range is listed right on the package . I was so impressed by the comfort , sound and price ( I paid $ 14 per pair ) that I bought 5 pair , so that I could have replacements when the others wore out . So far I still have the original pair and they sound great . Maybe the people complaining put the jack in the cigarette lighter plugin ? Not sure , but the sound is great for $ 14 . I love the adjustable volume on the cord . I listen to music with headphones at work , often 6-7 hours a day , so comfort is paramount .
  This pair of headphones was alright . I won't really say it was all that great . I didn't really like the fact that it was somewhat tight around my head and I have a small head too , my ears would hurt after a while but if I wear it around my neck it 's just huge and uncomfortable . Mines didn't last for three month , it just broke . Other then that the sounding of it is alright . If you ask me , I say to keep looking .
  I read a lot of reviews before choosing a new alarm clock and this was rated very high . Now that I have the alarm clock , I would agree with what most people have said about the clock . It is easy-to-use , a nice size , and I like that the numbers are a larger size .
  I never thought I would have made such a bad purchase when I bought my HK DVD 5 . The unit is in for repairs more than it is playing DVDs . The worse part is that practically no one in America is qualified to repair these things so you have to ship your unit half way across the US to get it fixed ( at your expense ) . Mine just stopped working for no reason at all . I eventually found out that the power supply went bad , after owning it for 14 months ( the warranty was over ) . Strictly from a warranty / repair viewpoint I will never buy HK again . I purchased a Panasonic DVD player while my HK DVD was in for repairs and I swear the picture is just as good if not better .
  Does exactly what it is supposed to do . Arrived when it was supposed to arrive . Overall , a very nice experience .
  This case has no place for your extra battery . That is the biggest reason to bother with a case . To make things worse , you are expected to feed your camera 's strap through a hole in the case flap each time you place it into the case .
  I 'm not gonna rant because finding a DTV indoor antenna is pretty much trial and error . I tried this one on the upstairs tv which has a Radio Shack dipole and loop ( unamplified ) and it did worse . I tried it on the downstairs tv which has either an outdoor antenna or a old dipole ( rabbit ears ) and again it was worse . In fact I unplugged the dipole and the picture was just as good with no antenna as with this one . so far none of the amplified antennas I 've purchased have shown any improvement over passive antennas . The search goes on .
  It 's such a shame that Logitech discontinued this multi-featured model some years ago , but these suppliers seem to have some left - for which I am grateful ! The only thing that went wrong with my last one was that the rubber coating wore off where the thumb rests and this didn't affect its efficiency . It took three weeks to arrive but within their estimated timescale . Most pleased with the mouse and their service
  I got this as a gift and the truth is I 'm terribly disappointed . When i opened the box and saw it , i thought it 's going to be at least a formiadable foe for the Ipod Nano . However , as i fo one using it , i found a bunch of things that make me run away from Sandisk product forever . First of all , this comes with a crappy software , cheap navigation buttons , and distastful design . When i first installed the sofware to my computer , my whole computer got frozen . It wasn't my computer problem for sure because it 's a new one and it 's the model second to the XPS line of Dell . After several times trying to install it with all kind of technical support , i finally suceeded . Then came the transfering of music and thankfully it worked . I was quite happy back then since at least i got it working . However , my excitement was short-lived . The second time i tried to put some more songs into it , I saw duplicates of the previous songs in my mp3 , not one but three . I thought that would be a waste of memory , so i deleted the duplicates . It wouldn't let me delete anything , i kept receiving the error message . After a few minutes trying to refresh the device but see no changes , I unplugged the device and check the songs , my list of songs was emptied . Again , I went through the time-killing task just to get my songs back in the mp3 . These problems kept happening and the custumer support as well as the homepage sever doesn't help to solve a thing . My family currently owns several Ipods and none of them has encountered such problems like this one . Ipod is pricey but " you get what you pay for " .
  I 've only been using my MD for a month now , but I 've had nothing but great luck with it . I purchased the MD on a recommendation from a photographer friend of mine that has 3 of them and never had one problem with them . I 've heard if you are rough with them , you may encounter more problems . I 've only shot 1500 pictures with mine , but it keeps up no problem . No corrupt photos . I love it !
  If you only need a short optical cord , you can get this one for $ 3.00 with shipping and it works fine . Why pay more ?
  I have been working with photography for over 20 years and love to travel . Tamrac Velocity 8x sling pack is the best bag I have ever owned . All my equipment fits perfectly inside . This bag is extremely comfortable to carry and easy to access all items . I highly recommend this pack .
  Not a bad handheld c b outdoors its good . inside a building with metal roof transmit is not that good . I got two radios from Amazon very happy and the price was a great buy .
  These headphones are one of the best I 've heard in a long time . Very good sound quality and comfortable too .
  As a medical transcriptionist , a comfortable keyboard is essential . I had exactly this keyboard and used it for years . Over the past few months , the keys began to stick and it was time for a replacement . After searching and ordering multiple keyboards , none of which worked for me because I was used to my old tried and true keyboard , I finally found this one . This is exactly the same keyboard ! I can again transcribe comfortably , accurately and rapidly . I am so happy and I am going to order another as a spare .
  Works perfectly and provides enough protection that I don't worry about the screen getting damaged when I put the Garmin in my glovebox or in my coat . Good price too .
  The Palm II is just a great thing you want to carry everywhere with you . This case just looked great and I would tend to trust 3com for the quality of their products .. Bad idea . The day after I bought this case , I found a nice crack on the screen of the palm . No way to know what happened but I did not do anything special and can not remember any peculiar shock . I must have just carried the palm in the case on my belt most of the time , and in my front pocket one hour as I used to do before to buy the case .. Sad story , I will end up with the fast but expensive ( $ 100 ) replacement program of 3com . Think twice before you buy this item !
  Bought the Toshiba when it first came out as a replacement for the Visor Edge . Walking in I knew a few things : 1 . This is not the most expandable PDA you are going to find . 2 . A backlit display draws alot of power . That said , I have been nothing but pleased with the performance of the E335 . It handles all of my tasks ; Email , web browsing , calendar , contacts , database and moderate mp3 play with aplomb . I can reccomend the E335 for an entry level palm , or in addition to a laptop , but not as a replacement for a laptop if you are a road - warrior . It does what it is intended to do well , but not much else . ( although , I can admin my network from the road , and on vacation with it , but it was a costly add-on cell cable . ) Also , choose medium quality mpeg 's for playback , as they loose sync in high quality ( plus , they save space . ) If you decide to order , add a minimum of a 64mb sd card to your cart , cause your gonna eat your memory quickly . If you have thoughts of adding on tons of extras , empty your cart and don't look back .
  Works perfectly . While traveling abroad , I use this with a single power adaptor to create four useable outlets . Also great for domestic travel whenever power outlets are scarce .
  I never even got to testing the audio quality because the ear piece was so uncomfortable . My ears are on the large side - but not huge - and this didn't fit well at all . I haven't had problems with other around-the-ear headsets but this one is rigid with a tight fit . Putting it on is a two handed operation requiring folding and tucking of ear parts . If I try to take it off with one hand it pinches my ear painfully . I 'll be returning it .
  - sound quality is excellent - takes a while to properly tune it and get sound perfect but once you have it on right setting it works very well-batteries last a long time-comfortable to wear
  After a couple of weeks of not working all that well , my Office Depot HP replacement cartridge stopped being recognized by the HP printer . Total b . s . ! I will never buy from Office Depot again , major hassle and major price gouging on their part , and the store is full of stuff you can find anywhere any way .
  Amazon was the only place that i could find this product . good pric fast delivery thanks
  This isn't a fair review of the product , because I received the wrong cord . I checked my order and even this review is asking me to review the cord that I wanted . But I received a cord that is useless to me . I needed to have the cord immediately , so I went to a camera store and got what I needed .
  MIc does a nice job .. good improvement over the onboard mic . Handles sound spikes better .
  After 3500 reviews can more be said ? The suction holder for my Garmin didn't hold anymore so it had to be replaced . The options were to spend very little money and get another window mount unit or a friction mount for three times the money . Obviously I opted for this type . I found it to be much more stable then I thought it would be . The weight and materials cause it to firmly stay put on my slanted and slick dashboard . It 's easier to remove for security or to another car and my windshield doesn't get those annoying rings on it . I 'll go with the general consensus - five stars for a design well done .
  Purchased the power supply to be able to use my GPS in the house . Either it is a defect or doesn't have enough power . Will check further when our four feet of snow goes away and I can get out . Sorry , it may be usable for lighter items . Don't know what will draw less current .
  These earbuds barely lasted me a week , and I guess that 's to be expected of something so cheap . Do yourself a favor and don't buy these .
  What Tripp Lite IN3006CG Notebook / Laptop Rapid Recharger for AA & AA Batteries USB LED is : Tripp Lite IN3006CG Notebook / Laptop Rapid Recharger for AA & AA Batteries USB LED is a battery recharger that uses the laptop or desktop as a power source to charge rechargeable batteries . The basic idea is to use your PC 's power to charge up your batteries quickly . What Tripp Lite IN3006CG Notebook / Laptop Rapid Recharger for AA & AA Batteries USB LED does : Tripp Lite IN3006CG Notebook / Laptop Rapid Recharger for AA & AA Batteries USB LED does absolutely nothing . My beef or complaint with Tripp Lite IN3006CG Notebook / Laptop Rapid Recharger for AA & AA Batteries USB LED : The Tripp Lite IN3006CG Notebook / Laptop Rapid Recharger for AA & AA Batteries USB LED sat there with it 's red indicator lights on for DAYS . Nothing got charged . I sent the first one back thinking we had a faulty model . A second model was sent to me , and it did the same thing . What really fried my beans was the fact the thing did not come with directions of any sort . One Amazon . com user put up some directions as he or she figured out to use a model , but that is just really shoddy on behalf of the manufacturer not to enclose directions of any sort in the package . I sent both models of Tripp Lite IN3006CG Notebook / Laptop Rapid Recharger for AA & AA Batteries USB LED back to Amazon . com for a refund . Good riddance !
  The product is very easy to install on both Windows 7 and Mac OS X. However what you can do with it heavily depends on the software you are using . I purchased it to transmit data from my Polar Heart Monitor to my Mac and PC . Polar 's software for Windows is top notch but is somewhat lacking on the Mac OS . However this is not something that should impact this product 's review I simply thought it was best to make this note . Great price and it works like it claims .
  I have the same exact problem everybody else did ! I used it for a little over a year , it was awesome while it lasted .. then I get that same problem . Black Screen , only a white horizontal line in the middle . Thats it . When you turn it on sometimes it works for like 90 seconds , and then goes bad again . It 's way too much hassle to send it back , I 'll just throw this in the trash and get a new one , from another brand of course . Stay away from this product .
  this is awesome .. i liked the design of this camera when i bought it .. that 's the reason why i bought it .. but now .. i like everything .. design , quality & etc .. the quality of the pictures is great .. have never ever seen it before ..
  I bought this with the hope of making my Canon MP830 wireLess . Set up went fine until my printer had to recognize the server .. ng . I found out then it doesn't work with all canon printers .. had to return .
  I 've had a 20GB iPod for 2 years now . It was sent to Apple twice in the first year to have the battery replaced ! This thing has been buggy since the day I bought first loaded music . Recently , it stopped playing songs altogether . It simply skips through my entire library , one song after the next , not playing anything . Now , it simply freezes as soon as you attempt to play music . Please , don't make the same mistake I made . Don't spend 200 - 300 dollars on a piece of technology that behaves more like a piece of .. well , you get the idea . I 've got to run .. time to get back on the phone with Apple 's tech support ..
  I love these headphones because they are transmitting on 900Mhz . There is no interference from other wireless devices . Just make sure you don't have other 900 MHz devices because there are only two 900Mhz to choose from .
  I purchased this in July and it has already died . I bought it because I liked the design but wouldn't recommend it . It was loud and now it doesn't even work . Support from La Cie is horrible and they only talk to you via email . No phone support .
  They don't make em like they used to . For the price not bad if your not particularabout precision . Don't look for audiophileperformance here at this price . The pros are it does looklike the 50 's turntable . It does play but the volume is low . there are no outputs of any kind . It 's just a basic player . There were cosmetic imperfections on mine and also manytechnically questionable items like speed variation , lack of precision in the tone arn lever etc etc . so if you don't expect much this little baby might give youa nostolgic buzz .
  Takes amazing photos in day light . However , night time photographs are just average . Pros : 1 . Not very expensive . 2 . Uses AA batteries . 3 . Good day time photos . Cons : 1 . Heavy . 2 . Night photographs are just around average . This is a great aim and shoot camera for amateurs .
  I 've had exactly the same problems as everyone else .. I have two InfoLithium NPFS11 batteries which have been apparently less and less able to hold a charge as time goes on . I reached the point where I wouldn't even bother to take my Sony DSC-P1 out with me anymore ! The batteries would last for two or three pictures then the camera would shut itself off . Thank goodness I found these reviews ! I was about to buy two new replacements , having no idea that EVERYONE has the same problem with these batteries . I followed the prevailing advice and sure enough the results are a spectacular reversal of fortunes - a saving of almost $ 100 ! I killed one battery by taking picture after picture with the flash . I eventually got to 114 pictures at 640 pixel resolution , having to switch the camera on again ( probably 8 or 9 times ) when the " battery life " indicator came on and powered down the camera . Ignoring what the camera 's telling you will mean that you will continue taking pictures for a long time . The camera actually gets HOT it 's being used so much ! Eventually the camera goes REALLY dead and the lens won't retract . Now I 'm recharging the battery , pretty confident that the old battery will be rejuvinated to it 's formerly effective self . This is exactly the advice given in the other reviews . HOWEVER .. for the second battery , rather than trying to quickly start taking photos BEFORE the battery life is calculated by the camera / battery , I let the calculation go ahead first . The camera indicated that the battery life was 80 minutes . I immediately started taking pictures and got up to 190 pictures ( using the flash ) . Again , the camera got quite hot in the time it took to take all those pictures . And even after all that time and all those pictures the camera showed that this second battery STILL had 45 minutes left in it ! Odd . What I 'm thinking is that it MIGHT not be entirely necessary to " kill " your battery in order to make it work properly . Maybe what you need to do - to kick your battery in the pants - is just take picture after picture for a few minutes as soon as you turn the camera on and it 'll reset the INFO part of the battery ! Worth a try . Obviously , you might need to do this every 6-8 months or when you notice the performance dropping off . Already this second battery is behaving like it used to - even without killing it . I have a hypothesis about the problem and why this " treatment " of your battery might breath new life into it . We tend to use our cameras in a very specific way that may be foiling the functionality of the InfoLithium system . We turn on the camera in preparation for taking pictures but it could be several minutes before we take a single picture . And we tend not to take pictures in rapid succession once we start . I think this cycle of switching the camera on , then doing little or nothing with it makes the battery go into some kind of " info-coma " after repeating this pattern for a long time ! I wonder if the way this technology was developed failed to take this real-world factor into consideration . I speculate that the laboratory testing of this device probably involved discharging the battery immediately after the battery life indication had been calculated . Maybe that process is what the battery needs to calibrate itself . After months of never receiving that treatment it 's possible that the battery no longer " knows " what the hell 's going on ! I 'd be curious to know if other people have the same results as I have . Email me if you like at nowis @ sbcglobal . net
  I read over 75 % of the reviews before I bought this and I was NOTdisappointed ! It has better feet than ones I looked at for 6 timesthe price , an excellent 1st Tripod for us novice photo bugs .
  it doesn't work so well in conjunction with a mac pro . I bought this webcam back in march 08 , and so far have been totally disappointed with its performance . the picture is grainy at best and all broken up at worst . sound appears to echo when used , I 've often had to cut short video calls due to problems with the sound . I 've since replaced this with the logitech 9000 pro , which at $ 20 less i consider a complete bargain . so far the 9000 pro provides a much crisper image ( i have yet to try the sound out ) .
  My headphones are a bit worse for wear ( my fault ) but these are my go-to headphones when I really want to enjoy a piece . Good frequency response high and low . Very comfortable even with all-day use .
  Read the mixed reviews , decided to give it a try considering the price . Worked great out of the box without any software installation on XP . First , the Cons . Tried to assign copy / paste function to forward / back button but was unsuccessful . I had the same problem with other Logitech products . Pre-set buttons work well but any other programmable buttons seem to be hit or miss , like enhanced function buttons on my wireless keyboard never worked . Tech support via email was slow and not very helpful . Not a big deal , though . Hitting Ctrl + c is actually easier than reaching for the forward rocker switch . Pros . Mouse looks and works great . Size is smaller than desktop but since this is a laptop model , that was expected . Tilt wheel , which lets you scroll horizontally is great . No problem with Firefox and All-in-One Gestures extension . USB receiver could be a little smaller , but I love the way it stores inside the mouse when not in use . Tracking seems good on desktop or on my pants once you increase the sensitivity . Conclusion . With the current rebate , it 's a great value . Highly recommended for anyone with the need for cordless mouse .
  I got mine from Amazon a few months ago . I had a 73 and moved up to the Mvc-FD95 . Couldn't be happier . I Never leave home without it . I have no gripes with the camera . I still use 35MM and 120 when necessary , but lean to Sony for most day to day shots . I have not found another camera I would swap it for as digitals go . If you are looking for " The " digital camera this is it ! The 3.5 floppies are easy to work with and you can change resolution at a moments notice . It will have to pried from my hands !
  The card itself is a good card . I got recommendation from my friends , that 's why i brought it . But the product was NOT in RETAIL PACKAGING ! it arrived in that plastic box CF cards have in a yellow envelop . When I started taking pictures , the numbering started in 2500 or something like that-someone used to card and took that many pictures with it already ! I emailed the company , complained about the product , they did not reply . I was really upset because I could have gotten the same thing from my friend for $ 30 in retail packaging , but I figured since I had the gift card here , and amazon has good service , i might as well just get it . So I left a really bad review on the seller 's site . The next day , they finally contacted me . After half heartedly asking me what the problem was , they said to send in the card and they 'll replace it for a new one . Then the guy asked me immediately to log on into my account and remove the review because the problem was solved . I was so stupid and did it that time ! I should have waited until the problem has really been resolved . The guy told me he attached a note saying that they 'll TRY to send it in retail packaging but can't promise anything , I was slightly annoyed , and said that that 's your description , and was like WTF . I send the product in , after more than a week , I finally got the card again . This time still the same thing ! A card in a plastic container ! The numbering of the photo was pretty much where I left it off ! THEY SEND BACK THE CARD I SEND IT TO THEM ! I spend all these money and time dealing w / shipping , feeling a little bad because I didn't buy it from my friend , now I still don't have what I wanted : a NEW 2gb Ultra II CF card ! another little note , when the same card came in the mail the second time , the invoice no longer said Ace Photo , but Focus Camera ? ! I 'm just tired of dealing with this seller ( the helps person makes no promises and likes to digress and talk about weather and asks for my cell number ? ! .. why on earth do I care about the weather when my primary concern talking to him is for a NEW CF card ? ! And shouldn't he be WORKING instead of chatting w / his customers ? ) and I complained to Amazon , hopefully they 'll resolve the problem .
  I use behind-the-neck headphones for my ipod and they are super comfortable so I figured that this would be great for gaming when I needed to use ventrillo . Not the case . After an hour of wearing these , the backs of my ears hurt so much that I couldn't bear to put them back on . I returned them the next day . If you need to use them for long periods of time , I wouldn't recommend them at all . The AHS 515 set is MUCH more comfortable .
  I love my Kindle and I use it a lot . The cover helps because it keeps me from accidentally hitting the previous page bar . However .. the little nubby thing that 's supposed to keep the Kindle in place broke almost immediately . The result is that the Kindle keeps slipping as I read it . I was going to buy another cover , but if it 's the same old same old I think I 'll pass .
  This alarm is higher quality ( but more expensive ) than most other small battery-operated apartment / home burglary alarms , and can sense movement quite well . To me , it was a big plus that not only does it have a loud audible alarm when tripped , but also a small strobe-like pulsing light , as well as the ability to turn the unit on and off with the single ( included ) remote control ( FYI : In fact , the remote is the only way the unit * can * be turned on or off ) . It also looks somewhat imposing , as if it were part of a " real " , hard-core wired alarm system . The only slightly negative issue is that the remote control only works from a range of about five feet ( the alarm 's motion sensing capability , however , is far longer than that - but this is not a problem because the alarm is delayed for about 12 seconds to allow you to get close enough to turn the unit off before the alarm / strobe activates ) . You may also want to purchase another remote ( which Amazon also sells ) if you have a spouse or a child .
  I was about to email you to see how I could send this back . The unit I purchased does not work correctly . It stops in the middle of a song . It sometime starts half way though a song . It does not shuffle correctly , maybe three out of the five cd 's . It could just be the unit I purchased or have you found similar problems ? Please let me know how to send this defective unit back . Thank you , Jerry
  Worked once , then quit . When hooked up to computer and turned on , a message pops up saying device detected , may not work properly . No lie . A complete waste of money .
  seems like a pretty good product for the money spent . there are only 3 presets on am and another 3 for fm , weatherband seems good . the master volume controls all sounds , so if you set it quite for the alarm clock , its going to be quiet when the weather alerts go off . so far i have only had 2 storms that came with watches , and the regular tests since i purchased this . all registered fine . fm tuner seems a little weaker than most radios , and there is some " bleed " between channels . but i didn't buy this for just a clock radio feature . i do like that you can choose what watches and warnings trigger an alarm . there is a feature that allows you to listen to all alerts and also isolate just to one county code , nice so you don't hear watch alerts all night when its raining out .
  My daughter squealed in delight as soon as she saw this mouse . She couldn't work the buttons on my large mouse , but this one is the perfect size for the typical 3-4 year old ( my daughter 's 2 1/2 , but very big for her age ) . Running Windows 7 , I was able to hot swap this mouse for my old one ( meaning the computer was running when I made the change ) . The Tiny Mouse worked instantly . The pointer speed was pretty high , but that was easy to adjust ( Start->Control Panel->Mouse->Pointer Options->adjust the speed slider until it feels right ) . My daughter 's been using this mouse for about a week , and I 'm amazed at how adept she 's become with the PC . She just needs Daddy to turn on the speakers and monitor ( too high for her to reach ) and she can log in , start whichever game she wants and play it all by herself . This is one of the best kids ' products I 've ever bought .
  This does not fit the Kodak Z712 camera so don't be mistaken that since it fits the Z710 it is close enough . It is not .
  This is a wonderful machine . It is compact and efficient . It is compatible with several database software products allowing for easy , on the road access to all types of information . It holds 1000 pages of text per MB of memory which makes travelling a breeze . No longer do I need an extra briefcase for my books . Currently , with just a 128 MB compact flash card as an accessory , I have 7 books , 13 audible . com audible books , multiple pictures as well as all my MS Outlook contact addresses , phone numbers , email addresses . Further , I can download and respond to my email from this little pocket-size phenom . It has never , never failed me .
  If you use a trackball , it is very important that you use it while hovering your whole arm . Your fingers should be the only part of your arm touching anything . It 's important to keep in mind that improper use of a trackball could be just as bad , or worse , than using your normal mouse . The physical ball itself needs 2-3 days of normal use to fully break in , so give it some time . After it does , though , it 's super smooth . Be sure to swipe away the dust that accumulates on the ball bearings if it starts to feel stiff . It also helps to use a lower mouse sensitivity than you normally use .. when I first started using this trackball I had a hard time with precise movements ( like copy and pasting text ) , but that really helped .
  Not sure what the other reviewer 's problems were . This CDRW has been a dream for me . Speedy , with no significant problems whatsoever .
  I purchased this switchbox so that I could toggle between at 15 " computer monitor and a 40 " flat screen TV without changing the cable on the back of the computer each time . I installed the cables , turned the switch and heard an audible click . When I turned the switch back there was no sound , but around 15 seconds later , there was a very faint click . As I toggled back and forth between the displays using the switchbox , only the monitor hooked to the setting that had the audible click would display correctly . So , back it went . In summary , not a good product . Tried to give NO STARS , but I guess you can't . :(
  So far not a single disc has been unusable , after going through several hundred discs . These are the best DVD + Rs I have found .
  Have been using for about a month and everything works well . It was a replacement for an older kit . Able to use the remote from the old kit with this also .
  This CD player rox ! It :* Will not skip-has 40 sec . anti-skip plus advanced shock protection * Comes with unbeatable headphones-they are the most crisp and clear-sounding headphones around-even better than some Sony headphones * Has alot of features , such as hold , pause , play , stop , track-finder , program , mode , repeat , and more . * Looks awesome * is priced at a great price for such a good discmanBad things ? There isn't a one ! If your looking for an awesome discman at an unbeatable price , you 've found it-it 's right here !
  this product is a best buy . it is easy to carry and produces a clear product
  I bought this for my wife to supplement our P-400 ( 8x10 ) . We went digital almost 3 years ago with the Olympus C4040 and P-400 and I was looking for something to do 4x6s w / o having to cut 8x10s down all the time . I 've always been partial to Olympus , having worked extensively with the OM-1 as a photographer in the early 90s . We were very happy with the results we received from the P-400 and I have to say the prints from the P-10 are stunning , if not better . The cost per print is about 39 , which is a bit more than taking it to some of the local pharmacies ( though we live in the middle of nowhere , we 'd more than make up for it in time and gas ) . Plus there 's something to be said for the convenience of printing at home . Print time is reasonable , what you 'd expect from a dye sub . The greatest benefit to me is that you don't get the diffusion dot patterns you find with the ink-jet " photo " printers . If you want " photos " , dye sub is the only way to go - and the bottom line is the P-10 gives the quality I want at a reasonable price .
  I am very satisfied with this purchase . It arrived undamaged and is well made . The screen is an excellent value . My family and I have been enjoying movies on the big screen for the past two months . Even the doubters are loving it .
  This is the first MP3 player I 've ever had . It is wonderful . After a few weeks of research I had compared the new IPOD Shuffle 1GB , the SanDisk 1GB , the iRiver 1GB , and the N200 . The N200 gets you the most features , and best quality for the best price . You can drag and drop any MP3 or WMA file directly onto it in a matter of seconds . It doubles as a flash drive you can use it to save documents and other important information . It has an in line recorder which allows you to connect to any audio unit with a headphone jack ( 3.5mm ) and record directly from it . It has a built in FM radio with better reception than I can get in my truck . You can record songs directly off the radio as well . The LCD screen is ambidextrious and easy to read . This unit requires no software , it will plug and play instantly . PRO'sTiny size1GB Flash Memory ( holds 240 MP3 's and almost 500 wma 's ) FM RadioIn line recordingMicrophoneGood LCD ScreenComes with armband and belt clipWonderful sound from earbuds ( you can also connect it to your cars tape cassette player with your old cd-tape connection . ) Easy to useLong Battery LifeCons : Have to use a cord to connect via USB ( as opposed to MuVo TX FM direct connection . In Line recording picks up lots of static and other noise . Earbuds are too large for most people ( unless you have Dumbo ears like me ) Microphone only practical for recording " notes to self " Have to navigate through menu to switch from music to FM . Overall this is a very strong product that beats out all other micro players ( especially the iPod Shuffle . If you don't care about the in line recording feature go ahead and purchase the MuVo TXFM 1GB for the convenience of direct USB connection .
  I bought the Kensington model # 33917 notebook power adapter when I was on a trip and had left my normal ThinkPad power supply at home . The power supply worked great for 35 days and then just died . Kensington technical support was great to work with - they sent me a replacement immediately . Unfortunately , that replacement died a couple of months later after only 6 days of usage . Again , their tech support was very courteous and helpful and sent me another one . If I had been traveling when the 1st and 2nd power supplies died on me , that would have seriously inconvenienced and possibly crippled my ability to do my job - even more so if there wasn't an electronics store around to buy a replacement . At this point , I can't rely on this particular model of power supply so this latest replacement will stay at home for use only in emergencies .
  Have owned this for a little over a year . The CD player just broke . I am buying a sony now
  packaged great , arrived fast . Will deal with again , A + A + A + A + A + A + A + A + A + A + A + A +
  if you own an nolt3 the lens doubler will not fit your unit as night owl optics says it will , thought my unit had the wrong size lens on it and after talking with night owl they said it was their mistake and they should not show the lens double compatable with the nolt3 , so just be ware it will not fit this unit .
  The adaptor that comes with the Apple Powerbook did not last as long as it should have ! Then to charge that expensive cost for replacement .. Shame on them ! I accidentally dropped and bent the first adaptor that I bought from you and replaced it and still have enough left over to buy another if needed ! WHY ? Apple ?
  The stereo looks great on the wall . The illuminating colors are amazing . Everybody got impressed with it . But right now the CDs are not working . The only thing I can hear is the radio . And now the illuminating lights are having trouble . It has only 3 months of warranty . but it didn't last a year . I like the looks but its not reliable . They replaced it with a new one but its no wall mountable . I don't recommend it
  Just took this little beauty down to the great barrier reef in Australia and it worked like a charm . easy to maintian . Allows utilization of all functions of the camera , except the swivel screen . took excellent pictures when camera is set on Underwater Mode . They were charging $ 15 a pic on board . I took over 1000 on this trip and underwater video . Well worth the money if you are into scuba or snorkeling .
  While the picture quality is quite good with this camera , the shutter delay is quite extreme . The low rating is more a factor of the quality of the camera and the post-purchase customer support . The camera completely stopped working just out of the one-year factory warranty . Kodak has a flat fee of $ 150 to repair . The camera stopped working once again after the third use , but since it was out of the 30-day repair warranty , Kodak would only offer another $ 150 repair or an upgrade to one of their other cameras with a trade in . The cost of the upgrade was more than the street price of the camera .
  This is a very good products , I used it like camera swither . In the church am using two and pure soon three cameras , so am mixing the images with this products , the other good thing is this products no make noise when I swhit to the other camera . ww . temploalfayomega . net God bless everyone , Even if u don't belive .
  I purchased this cartridge for an Epson C88 + and it was apparently not compatible . It fit in the printer just fine , but the printer acted as if it wasn't present . It could have been my setup , though .
  Satisfactory card for converting classical LPs to CDs . The software interfaces are easy to use , and the resulting audio files produced using Audacity and burned on to CDs sounded fine , and had acceptably low levels of electronic noise . Sorry the card died .
  What a shame ! This is a great product idea that lacks the needed speed to actually be useful . After a lot of time setting up and transferring files , I am returning this unit . I had the unit set up for RAID-1 ( mirror ) with two of the recommended 500 Gig Segates . The transfer rates are so slow that it is literally unusable . Also , although the external temperature was not obviously hot , the inside disks were smokin ' . I expect more from linksys / cisco .
  I 've been working with computers for over 20 years and this is one of the worst products I 've come across . When I first got this device , my intention was to help me replace a hard drive in a laptop . I followed their instructions , booting from the CD , and within 5 minutes , my existing hard drive was no longer bootable ; dead in the water . Several calls to their Tech Support went unanswered ( left messages , no returned calls ) . It was a Friday afternoon ( yeah I know , never do this stuff on a Friday afternoon .. ) . At 4PM ( Pacific ) I called and got a recording telling me that they were closed and that the hours were from 8 - 5 ! ( I guess they can't tell time either .. ) So much for getting any Support . I had to spend the better part of Saturday doing a fresh Windows Vista install on my new hard drive and reinstalling all of my applications . Fortunately I was able to copy data from the old hard drive - only the master boot record was destroyed , none of the data . Monday I get a call back and was told that it is absolutely impossible for their software to ' trash ' my hard drive . Okay , you 're right , I did it myself - just so I could spend an entire day reinstalling a computer and so I could complain about their product .. Yep , so much for Tech Support . Oh , did you know that their product does not work on dynamic drives - was that anywhere in their ads , system specifications , software cautions ? After getting the machine back to a running state , I thought I 'd keep it and use it as a spare drive . However , it goes off-line " whenever it feels like it " and maybe you are in the middle of saving something , maybe you are not . When it is working , it appears to be a good product - but there is no guarantee that it will be working when you want it to be working . If I were you , I 'd spend your money elsewhere .
  Takes great pictures of still situations . Has various modes ( landscape , sport , portrait ) , or an auto mode that will figure things out if you 're a novice ( like me ) . It even has a cool sepia mode for taking an old-fashioned sort of picture . The extra large view finder is great for this far sighted old guy . A really nice camera , perfect for my use - taking photos to put on websites . The only problem is the really confusing on-camera interface . My other cameras have a much easier to understand interface . The accompanying software is also short in the ability department ( you can't delete pictures from the software , making picture management a hassle ) . But , it does transfer pictures fine . If you 're looking strictly for picture quality , and general usage , I 'd give this 5 stars . But for the whole package , four stars .
  I love this product . I was a little skeptical due to the price .. but I must admit I am happy so far . The device and all the hardware included is very sturdy and there is no need for finding or buying alternative bolts or screws . I have purchased two of these and It fits both televisions ; including the cheap one ( proscan brand ) . The installation was easy . once you get the bracket installed the rest is a piece of cake . It can tilt slightly ( which is perfect for me ) , but if you are looking for a major tilt , I would recommend using another brand . If you are looking for a system that is resonably priced , yet strong and sturdy , this may be the one for you .
  This was my fourth palm in seven years . I now have a pocket pc put out by Dell . I have had it with Palm
  I bought this for the space it offered ( 60GIG ) because it is the cheapest 60 gig music & video player out on the market . I only use this for playing music and all I can say is that is the best thing in the world because I can carry my music library in my ipod . The best thing about the ipod is that it lasts me about 15 hours of pure mp3 playing with EQ & Backlight ON . If you get some descent headphones & turn on the EQ to your liking than you wont be disapointed . I was originally gonna get it from apple but Amazon offered me the same product for cheaper . I recommend getting A good case ( I got a black eVo3 case ) because if you dont I guarantee you that your screen will scratch . I consider this a very good investment becaue I am sure this will last me for a long time . If you listen to music 24/7 like I do than this is going to become your best friend . If you are getting this for video playing than I suggest you look for something else because this will only last you for about 3 hours . The screen is nice but There are other better ones out there .
  JVC XM-P55XL is just a player , it doesn't record . Normal MD player costs around $ 100-$150 dollars . What consumer should buy instead is a MD player plus recorder . Which cost around same as JVC XM-P55XL
  I loved the size and color ( red ) .. nice and compact without being too small - I can hold it comfortably in my hands . I love the large LCD screen . The controls are easy to use .. the ' recall last picture button ' on top by the power button is so convienient because everyone wants to see the pictures . I 'm still learning the little features of the camera , but you can point and shoot right out of the box . I love that the camera has a 5x optical zoom and the lens stays inside the camera - amazing - the slide door protecting the lens after use is also nice and a feature of all the sony T series . The movie mode is awesome - you can take as long a movie as you want - until you fill up your card or run out of battery - plus the sound quality on the recordings is great for such a small camera . I 've found the battery holds it 's charge very well .. bought a spare anyways .. using a 2G card so can take tons of pics . It 's definately not a SLR - but man .. takes great pics .. even mirco zoom pics .. I own a digital SLR for my photography habit - but this camera takes almost the same quality pictures - 8mp ! Crazy - do we need that many pixels ? ( my digital SLR is only 6mp ! ) . I have better zoom and wide angles on the SLR , but I use this one to take everywhere - the digital SLR is too big to carry around all the time :) The camera makes cute sounds turning on / off ( I haven't added music yet but you can ! ) . Nice black and white and sepia modes . You can play / edit the picture after you take it on the LCD screen . So easy to use . Cute and sofisticated . Compact , but easy to hold . SO far no complaints and I 'm recommending it to friends . They like it too .
  I purchased this camera because of all the high ratings I saw people give it . In addition to that I knew someone who owned one and loved it . I set it all up and started taking picture , it was easy to use and the image quality seemed very good , that is until I attempted to take a picture of someone standing in a doorway . There is a horrible barrel distortion around the entire picture . Any straight line I tried to get in a picture was completely curved . Needless to say I returned it the next day .
  I 've had this unit for a very long time . There have been times that it did not work and then all of a sudden it starts working again . One big drawback - it will not work with ( + ) disks .
  Hay varios discos que me han salido defectuosos , al momento de usarlos con mi camara sony dcr-dvd205 algunos han salido malos .
  I just received my Dlink DSM-320 . I was initially excited about the product , but after attempting to use it I quickly realised that it needed another 3 or 4 months to be ready for prime-time . Let 's start with the big issues : 1 . Component out is broken . I tried this on 3 different TVs with component out ( Sony Wega , JVC IArt and Pioneer SD-643-HD5 ) and each time the picture was displayed with a severe blue cast ( everything was shades of blue ) . I tried another DSM-320 and the same problem existed , even AFTER the firmware upgrade . How something like this could slip by Quality Control I have no idea . 2 . Wireless compatibility is pathetic . I have been using wireless networks since they came out . I am somewhat familiar with configuring them . My entire wireless network is DLink AirPlus XtremeG running at 108Mbs , with compatibility for 54Mbs and 11Mbs hardware . This worked because I had people connect their laptops to my network for printing and browsing the web . I , of course , had SSID Broadcast disabled so I typed in the SSID into the DSM-320 along with my other network information and it refused to find my network . After turning down my network speed and broadcasting my SSID it connected , but then refused to download the firmware update . It was stuck at zero . The machine froze and I had to pull the plug to reset the machine . Playing videos started well , but 2 minutes in the machine would freeze with no network activity and the plug would have to be pulled . In short , the wireless functionality was terrible , and I like DLink stuff . 3 . Does not maintain the aspect ratio . I bought this planning to use my machine as a video jukebox . I have a dedicated TV card ( Hauppauge PVR-250 ) and schedule my TV recordings over the internet . The DSM-320 was going to allow my to watch these videos on a TV instead of the computer . Also , I have a large hard drive that serves as a movie jukebox . The movies are kept in their original widescreen aspect ratios ( 16:9 or 2.35:1 ) . I was very surprised to notice that the DSM-320 did not display the black bars required to make the picture look normal . It filled the screen with the picture and made everyone look tall and skinny . Those are the big problems , it is also plagued by the slow menus and horrible server software mentioned in other reviews . I guess the biggest compliment I can give it is that when connected to a wired network , and while using s-video , it worked great . Even the wife could navigate the menus ( slowly ) , play music ( provided I had setup the M3U playlist for her on the server computer ) , look at pictures and play videos . Unfortunately , there are other products that will do those things better and cost $ 100 less . Do I think the DSM-320 has potential ? Yes , but it needs several firmware upgrades to fix those big problems I outlined . I 'm not waiting for that though , I 'm sending mine back . 7-16-04
  I 've had the card for a few weeks now and used it to take over 900 pictures and a total of about 5 minutes of video . It has worked flawlessly . Obviously , a lot depends upon your specific camera , but in my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3 there is a fast recycle time and the video is smooth . It does get a little warm , but that is typical of these high-capacity cards .
  I purchased this to listen to at work . When I first plugged it in , I was very happy . This review is on the product , not the service . I have no cmoplaints about XM service , but this reciever must have never been designed to be listened to for more than 45 minutes at a time . I had on that cut on and off all the time , and I thought it was defective . I received a new one , and the same thign . It is as if the receiver overheats and shuts itself off . After about 1/2 an hour of " rest " it will come back on , but beware , only for about an hour . This product is great if you will be in and out of your car , and you do not intend to use it for more than an hour a day . Otherwise , stay clear .. nothing but a headache !
  I am just a week end photo fan . use an olympus E620 which is a great system . Live on Lake Erie , shoot a lot around the water . There are hundreds of filters on the market , Reading on line this was considered a good basic filter to start with . This filter makes a big difference shooting sky / water photos , Great definition , great contrasts . easy to use . Not understanding the hundreds of filters available I can only say this filter is really helpful for a novice . Steve in Cleveland
  Bought a Garmin C330 a week ago . Tested it in San Francisco . It lost signals several times on crowed streets . It took at least 1 min to recalculate funny routes . There are 2 next exits : one to Freeway 101 , the other to Hi way 280 . Instead of following the exit to Freeway 101 , it directed us drive to highway 280 . After 5 mins , it asked us to take exit and go back to 101 to San Jose . Will return it . Today it is not worth more than $ 100 even it carries a brand name . If you live in big cities , don't buy this out of date GPS . All new GPS have high sensitive receivers to catch the signals ( 20 channels ) far better than Garmin C330 ( only 12 channels ) .
  I am not rating the product , because I never got it to operate in my computer . It was the wrong part and did not fit . My biggest problem was with the distributor , who after recommending the product refused to accept return , because I had opened the product to install it and therefore harmed the original packaging which made it " unsaleable " . My e-mail inquires were ignored .
  ive had this computer for about 3 years now and its still working great . havent really had any problems with it . i often have itunes and firefox while editing images , and it performs great . the only con would be all the unnecessary software thats preloaded on it , but that can be easily uninstalled . great buy , but there are newer and better things out there now
  If you have a new 3G Iphone , this cable will not work . It does not have the necessary authentication chip for bringing up the TV out option on the phone . If you have a universal dock , there is a cable that you can buy from apple for $ 49.99 that will work .
  I have no problems with my CX6000 ; it prints nicely and is a decent scanner . What kills the whole deal is the Epson Ink life . I have given up on dumping good money after bad on Epson ink carts which seem to last only 30 to 40 pages . Maybe I don't print everyday and the ink could be drying up . But I changed the carts less than a year ago and it is unsat that it should go from full to empty after about 50 or so prints over a year . Oh , note that if one cart is out , then the printer won't let you ignore the error and make a emergency print ; even if you have plenty of black and just want to do B / W. You 're stuck until you fork over the money and get that other cart replaced . I am going to cut my losses and toss this CX6000 in the trash , I am so disgusted . I 'm going to stay with proven products like HP . It might cost a little more , but their carts don't crap up like Epson .
  This is my first gps watch and I love it so far . I 've used it on runs and bike rides and it is always within 5 hundredths of a mile . The best feature for me is the integration with RunKeeper . To import new workouts , I simply connect the watch to my computer , go to runkeeper and import the workout directly from the watch . The only thing I don't like is the size , but I don't really notice it when I 'm running .
  Easy to setup . Looks good . The tunable tip saved me made instalation that much easier and that much faster . I would recommend this antenna to anyone , in fact i bought a second one as a gift .
  too large & bulky , but does the job it 's designed for .. certainly not a space saver , but it will organize your cables neatly .. worth buying IMO ..
  Do not buy this product believing it will allow you to send the signal from your computer to two screens , or to a TV . This product will not work without buying an expensive booster . Amazon stood by their return policy so this venture didnt cost me anything except some time .
  I am totally impressed with the product .. Great picture even in low light conditions ..
  I anxiously awaited the arrival of this tripod . My grandchildren were coming for a visit , and I was looking forward to taking many photos while they were here . Imagine my disapointment when I took it out of the carry bag , and it was in 9 pieces ! The cheap plastic on the pan head was just shattered ! It had been stored in a corner of the closet , and I had not touched it since the day it arrived . I opened the bag , and little pieces of broken plastic fell out . I don't have a clue why it would fall apart like that , but don't waste your money on this one .
  Seagate harddrives have a 5 year warranty and usually don't break as often as some others . Their performance is great .
  I bought this model LCD TV on 9/06 and was pleased with the price and performance . But slowly odd behavior manifested , such as random booting . Then the remote became unresponsive , and the only solution was to switch the TV off / on . Then the remote failed completely , and we couldn't even use the case buttons to power off .. we had to pull the plug and restart . A call to Crutchfield ( the seller ) was made , and a replacement exchange was made in November to my satisfaction . Well , the replacement unit began its own abnormal behavior within 3 months . It seems to be heat-related , as the screen display will de-stabilize ( and become un-viewable ) for about 20 minutes after powering on , then clear up after 10-15 minutes . It doesn't matter what the source is ( OTH , DVD Player , or computer ) , the picture goes crazy for approximately the same amount of time . Called them again , but Crutchfield won't provide a second exchange . Calling Customer " Service " at Westinghouse , they suggested relocating the TV to a different circuit in the house , stating that " these units are very sensitive to electrical current fluctuations " . Well , I tried to relocate the TV throughout the house with No Joy . I purchased a dedicated UPS / Line Conditioner .. no luck . Attempts to improve the cooling resulted in no noticeable changes . After these trails , Westinghouse suggested factory-authorized repair ( at my cost to ship ) . A quick Google reveals many horror stories related to people 's experiences with Westinghouse 's repairs ( or lack of completing them ) . Sorry , I 'm not going to spend any more time ( except to warn others ) or money on this sorry excuse for a television . What else am I to do .. move out of my 2-year old home to accommodate a " sensitive " TV ? None of the other electronics in my home have any problems . Every night , the wife gets a garbled-screen reminder of how I made a bad choice in trusting Crutchfield and Westinghouse . And despite being a bona-fide Geek , I find it very disturbing to be woken up in the middle of the night by the TV having switched itself on . I cannot believe that Crutchfield still sells this , and any other model , from Westinghouse . I will no longer be purchasing from Crutchfield , as they can no longer be trusted . The Westinghouse brand name has been subverted .. please stay away from it !
  I 'll talk about the cons first which other reviewers have mentioned . Thumbs Down : - There 's no TiVoToGo or multi-room viewing ( you can always keep your TiVo 2 active for the TiVoToGo ) - You cannot record HD from a Satellite receiver or cable box . - One reviewer mentioned sound drop-out when flipping around the guide . This happens to me also . - Press thumbs-up to record causes problems for me ( rebooting is the worst of the problems ) . I 've opened a ticket with TiVo for this and will avoid that feature for now . - Also , my TiVo rebooted every time it hit a particular part of an HD recording where the signal was dropping out . I 've also opened a ticket with TiVo . The problem has only happened once . - I will have to open a 3rd ticket with TiVo because I cannot access the broadband features like Yahoo . I had the same problem with my series 2 which required a software update to correct . - Cable card installation was finicky , but not as bad as the other reviewer mentioned . This was the first HD TiVo the tech had encountered , but the problems with the cable cards were with the company , not the TiVo . Both cards were working fine by the time he left . - Finally , the $ 800 price-tag is extreme ; especially given some of the problems I 've experience . - TiVo 's lifetime subscription is no longer available to new customers . ( Even the offer for existing customers expires 12/31 ) . Thumbs Up : - Being a TiVo customer since 2001 , my experience tells me they will resolve all the technical problems mentioned above . - This is TiVo ! Any of you who have TiVo know what that means . I was waiting for this TiVo before upgrading to HD and I 'm glad I did wait . - If you have a current lifetime subscription on a series 1 or 2 TiVo and can afford to drop $ 1000 . You should get this unit for the $ 800 + another $ 200 to transfer your lifetime service . This means no monthly fees and your old TiVo will still be active for a year . - This TiVo 's set-up does not require a phone connection like previous TiVos . The whole initial set-up took 20 minutes over my home network . - The remote is backlit and has a couple new buttons , but is the familiar TiVo remote . ( I use a logitech harmony remote though , which I love ) - Recording from 2 tuners ! The new series 2 also can record 2 shows , but it 's a definite plus made available on the series 3 . Press live tv to switch between tuners . - You can hook up an antenna to record HD content from your local stations for free . - 5.1 sound ! It 's great that TiVo records the digital sound along with the HD picture . Watching football last Sunday sounded almost like being in the stadium . - 480i content through the HDMI output is crystal clear . - The front display has control buttons , a clock , and displays the name of the show it 's recording . - It is quieter than previous TiVos . Overall , if you 're a current TiVo customer and you don't want to lose the interface you love when you switch to HD , you will want this box . If you 're new to TiVo , you will be amazed at it 's functionality . TiVo can record based on season passes or word-search wishlists and parents will love scheduling approved content for your children 's TV time . Some of you may want to wait for the price to come down and for TiVo to resolve some of the kinks before you buy .
  I got this printer because I was sick and tired of buying ink for the " free " printer / copier / scanner I got with my computer . I have an Intel Imac , a Macbook , and my husband has a Dell . I wanted all three computers to be able to print this printer easily , especially the wireless laptop . I connected the printer , installed the print driver on the Windows machine and the two macs found the printer without any effort whatsoever . I 'm now able to print from every room in the house , and it 's pretty darn cool . It was easy to set up and didn't take any time at all . ( And if we didn't have the Dell , it would have been even faster . )
  the cable works like it should and its at a great price . not much else to say about it .
  After reading numerous other Amazon reviews . along with several newsgroup postings , I at least have the comfort of knowing that MANY people have the same tragic tale to tell about this printer that I have . ( Okay , cue the violin . ) The printer worked just fine for about a year and a half - enough time for the warranty to expire - then suddenly developed an un-uncloggable clog . The printer will not deliver any ink from the black cartridge . ( I have read several variations on this story in which it 's either the yellow cartridge , or both the yellow and black . ) I have put in a new black cartridge , run countless cleaning cycles , and cleaned the black cartridge compartment with Original formula Windex , but no dice . I am told there 's a rubber suction hose that can come loose , but that still appears to be attached . My brother-in-law also said the hose appeared to be attached , but that a sponge seemed to be missing from the print head assembly . He then expressed the opinion that the whole printer " looks disposable . " Actually , a number of folks who 've written reviews have described the C84 as " disposable , " and there are two other points on which there seems to be a widespread consensus : 1 . The Durabrite ink in the cartridges is a double-edged sword . While it may be resistant to the kind of smearing that ink jet printouts are known for , it also dries to an ultra-hard consistency that is a major contributor to these un-uncloggable clogs . 2 . There may be a design flaw in the C84 's print head that Epson refuses to acknowledge . In fact , I contacted EPSON by email - they don't have a toll-free number - and they told me to do everything I 've already done . They went on to say that if I do everything they tell me and the printer still won't work , it requires service . DUH ! But of course , the service would cost as much , if not more , than a new C84 . Epson also claims that using non-Epson ink cartridges may be causing the problem , even though it may in fact be Epson 's ink that 's the culprit . Oh yes , and like so many other people who are telling this tale , I bought several new cartridges just before the printer broke down , and now I won't be able to use them . Well , at least I have one workaround for printing text . Since the color cartridges are still working , I can just turn my text dark blue . So , I can't recommend the C84 . But don't take my word for it . Trust me , you 'll find plenty of other reviews that say pretty much what I just said .
  I originally wrote a positive review for this product but now after having owned a few of these for over a year ( with frequent use ) I can report a very different side to these filters that many users will not notice until some time has elapsed . First I would like to mention that I am particular about my photography equipment and take steps to keep them clean . These filters were purchased with the intent to keep expensive lenses from getting covered in dust or damaged in regular use . These UV filters ( and presumably others ) work fine initially , but there is something the many positive reviews do not mention - these things are dust MAGNETS . That 's right . I don't know what it is about these filters , but once you take your lens cap off you 're going to have bits of dust and other airborne contaminants landing on there and getting stuck . A few specks of dust on the lens itself is no big deal - it will not even show in your photos , but the dust that sticks to these filters WILL show up on your photos if your photos have any kind of light areas . If you take a picture of the sky and do not have a perfectly clean B + W UV Haze filter , you will see black spots on the final exposure . I have tried to clean these using cotton cloth , microfiber and even methanol with no luck . By contrast I can keep my lenses clean with a simple puff of air or a wipe with microfiber . Even if there is some dust on my lens it does not show up in the photo as it does when it 's stuck on the UV filter . The quality of the glass that these UV filters are made from is also questionable . When I hold the filter up to a light , I can see many imperfections in the glass that appear as frosting . These imperfections are in the glass itself and cannot be cleaned . I have several of these filters and all of them exhibit the same flaws . UV filters do not provide any benefit photographically as digital cameras are not susceptible to the coloration issues that UV light had on film . UV filters can and do diminish the quality of your photos by placing inferior glass in front of your lens . It 's a catch-22 - you paid good money for a lens to take nice photos , only to hamper it by sticking a filter in front of it . With this filter on your lens , every photo you take is like no different than shooting through a window . Contrast and fine detail both suffer . These UV filters will cause " ghosts " and other optical anomalies at certain angles that you will not experience if you remove the filter . In the end it 's your call if you think it 's worth the extra money to make your camera take worse pictures under the false notion that the UV filter offers some kind of " protection " . Let 's face it - if you drop your lens , the possibility for breaking it will not be reduced by having a UV filter on the front . UV filters DO NOT keep your lens clean because they themselves attract dust and dirt , in addition to being optically inferior to the glass used in the lens , so the net result is a photo that would have been better with no filter at all . Save your money for something more useful like another lens , a good flash or a quality bag to carry your gear . These filters are a WASTE OF MONEY .
  This item is compatible with the panasonic 8.5 screen DVD player . Perfect fit and the item is very nice , not cheap looking and nicely padded . Definitely worth the extra price . Other cases available that were cheaper , but from the pictures , they looked it .
  Stopped working after some time . The connection b / n one of the wires and the plug , where a small board connects the wires to the pins , broke . Soldered , worked a bit , now it is broken again . Tried to fix a second time only to fry the fuse . Not happy with how long it lasted .
  I ordered these because the product text said specifically : WILL WORK WITH ANY IPHONE . Jbuds will not work with any iphone , they will only work with newer models , otherwise you have to buy an adapter . I actually knew about the adapter and the incompatibility issues before I ordered the jbuds , but because the ad copy stated : WILL WORK WITH ANY IPHONE , I assumed I would not also have to buy an adapter . I think that 's false advertising . you could have said anything you wanted in the space provided for your ad copy . You could have said " fits only new iphone models " ; you could have said " fits these models of iphone : " or you could have said NOTHING at all about the iphone , in which case I would not have purchased your earbuds . However : ANY IPHONE means ANY IPHONE - if it 's not ANY IPHONE then publish the specs and state the truth .
  I bought these to use after the rest of the family had gone to bed , so I could listed to music & watch movies without disturbing them . Unlike some of the other reviewers , I found the sound to be generally perfectly fine . Unfortunately , the sound was only clear when my head was stationary . Moving around the house or even turning my head cause a lot of cracks and pops in the sound . I found this so intrusive that these went back to Amazon after only a few hours . I couldn't see the point of paying .. for headphones that made my CDs sound like they were being played on a distant radio station . I guess that this is unavoidable to some extent , given that it is a radio signal that carries the sound to the headphones , but I was appalled how bad it was . So , I guess my take-home message is that if you 're considering these as your first wireless headphones , be prepared that the sound quality will not be as good as a pair that come with a cord .
  This was my first purchase of a digital camera . The features are pretty standard . The pictures I am able to take are either very good or fuzzy . The fuzziness applies to some of the pictures that the auto focus is unusable . For some reason and in certain situations , I am unable to get the AF to work . As I said before , when the AF works , I can get very good quality pictures .. You will want to get a bigger memory card too .
  I 've had one other dvd player which was a entry level player , However when I saw the performance of the toshiba 4700 In a electronic store , I was blown away .. So I bought the 4700 hooked it up to my dolby digital reciever and wow and double wowyou can set your center channel with this player so all dialogue comes through clear and crisp .. Plus the fact you can put in your own screen savers etc etc .. buy it you 'll love it .. Owen
  I have a MAC G5 and DELL Inspiron w / Bueray drive . First switch was defective but they sent replacement by 2nd day . Switch does not support blueray . My DVI cables all work directly from monitor to computer but not thru box . Avocent says blueray is not supported . The Mac mouse has a 2-axis scroll ' wheel ' but the switch reverses the horizontal and vertical axis . Avocent says the Mac mouse is not supported . Good luck :-( .
  I can't honestly rate this product since I still haven't received it . It 's almost been a month now and I haven't gotten it .
  After only minimal use , it works just like I wanted . I plan on spending a lot of time with manual in hand getting to the fine points of what it can do . I purchased it mainly to preserve family photos and slides , some over 100 years old .
  The 60CX is the best ! Its sensitivity is great . Works in my basement ! Works great in tree cover anytime of the year ! I really love Garmin products .
  I bought this remote because it was reccomended for the Ihome I was buying the remote did not work with that ihome or the ihome ih5 . Very unimpressed with this seller , would not use them again .
  I bought this item in a clerance sale in New Zeland after viewing through them . I was asounded by the optical clarity and complete lack of distortion and chromatic aberration . The image is razor sharp and the wide view gives great stereoscpic image depth . The contruction is solid - this is a well made optic . I cannot understand how these can be sold for only $ 50 USD . I paid only $ 25USD equivalent . I have compared them to the equivalent Pentax made in the Phillipines which were nowhere near the optical quality of the Galileo . The Pentax had marked pincushion distortion and severe CA and were 5.5 times the price . This is a truly astounding optical instrument which also demonstrates also the poor the quality control of other big brands manufacturing in third world counties . Well done Galileo and well done the USA !
  Wonderful very comfortable wrist rest with a durability problem . You must be careful not to position your elbow on the left side when relaxing or the pressure will eventually cause the seam to open and the gel to escape . The covering fabric is glued down when it should be stitched so it will separate . Otherwise the gel covered foam inside is firm yet soft . How do I know what 's inside ? Because two of them have torn open so far . Yuck , gooey gel ! I think that 2 stars is appropriate . Belkin should use a better glue .
  Sadly this mouse ( at least the release I have ) is horrible at interference . ( My version came with the MX 5000 keyboard . ) I had constant lag issues and could not figure out what was going on . I tried updating the software , I tried using it without the software , I tried using the Windows bluetooth and then Logitech 's software for that . Nothing I did worked , until I moved my computer into a different room from my wireless router . What Logitech doesn't tell you is that wifi devices and other wireless mice interfere with this mouse HORRIBLY . I don't know if a different Bluetooth adapter would fix the issue , but out of the box , the adapter it came with , this mouse does not function well . When you get it in a room with no interference , it works GREAT ! 5 star worthy . I purchased an MX620 and it 's updated adapter has no interference issues . I 'm currently waiting for my MX1100 to come in the mail so I can compare it to that .
  This printer worked great for 6 months ink was fine nice photo quality on prints . Now everytime I try to print the paper jams . I made sure the rollers are fine and unplugged / reset printer . Even tried different paper . Nothing works this printer is not worth purchasing for 6 months of use .
  PRODUCT ADVERTISED AS ORIGINAL HP LASERJET CARTRIDGE IN RETAIL PACKAGING . RECEIVED REMANUFACTURED CARTRIDGE AS A SUBSTITUTE . NOT HAPPY .
  I gave a 2-star rating only because of Garmin 's customer support ! The wrist unit itself work 's very well and I am very impressed with the ability of the Forerunner 305 to receive satellite signal 's , even on heavy overcast day 's ! However , I am experiencing , what I believe , is a simple problem with Garmin 's " Training Center " PC software that is included with the Forerunner 305 . After I had made NUMEROUS attempt 's to E-mail my question to Garmin Customer Support , I have come to the conclusion that Garmin does not want to be bothered with their customer 's technical question 's ! So , in conclusion , when my GPS unit eventually become 's inoperable , I will not bother Garmin with anymore of my money !
  It is strange that some people like them very much , while the others hate them with the same devotion . I am neither as I like them with some music and hate with some other . They are clearly not for rock / fusion / acid etc . Better for Jazz and Classic . They are 250 Ohms so do require some voltage not found usually in portable players . But even if put into decent stereo amplifier there is something weird about them . I think I know the secret that explains . If you open them ( and perhaps void your lifetime whatever ) You will see a big plastic screw on the driver that squeezes some foam material . The foam ( I call it a damper ) covers 4 holes in the driver . This is what makes the cans closed and this is the secret . Unscrew the damper - and the sound would be hollow with more bass . Screw damper tight - and there would be no bass whatsoever while the high and he middle will protrude . I 've ended with removing the damper completely and putting inside the cans some silicone wadding ( have more in my new pillows ) . Now they sound much better . Isolation is still as high . But there is more bass and the sound is not as hollow as before . Yes I am an engineer and I 've assembled quite some amplifiers , speakers and headphones for myself - So I sure know how to do it . If you are not the best friend of a screw driver and a soldering iron as I am , you may not like the experience .
  After reviewing the specifications on alot of pocket sized cameras , the following specs were considered necessary : 1 . Zoom2 . Megapixels3 . SizeThe Nikon Coolpix S10 won out . I am a little biased when it comes to Nikon products . I have had Nikon cameras for a long time . Only one Con : The are no filters available because Nikon did not thread the lens ring .
  The card was defective . Have applied for refund from amazon and have bought another to see if this one works . hopefully won't have to keep doing this too many times .. have already wasted a lot of time on this . Pretty frustrating .
  I have the 1 terrabyte ( Two 500gb drive ) version of this external drive configured as raid 1 for " secure " back up my files . After about 4 months , I suddenly get the blinking white button and the device is not recognize by my computer ( nor any other computer . Maxtor is no help whatsoever . I strongly suggest avoiding these products .
  This is a great camera . The 10x zoom is great and it can fit in your pocket . The image stablization is very effective especially at high zoom . The continous shooting and fast response time is very nice . If you want the big zoom but don't want to haul around an SLR size camera , and you are tired of missing the great shots because the camera is slow this is the camera for you .
  I 've had this for over a year now . This is an excellent TV with incredible image quality . Many TVs produce unpleasent reds , but this one handles every shade with ease . Blacks could be a little deeper , but it 's not a problem thanks to adjustability and great controls . The most detailed HD pictures look thoroughly convincing and vivid on this set . Even though it is rated an EDTV , this set looks better than most HDTVs sold up to 2005 , and at this size of 42 " the difference is hardly noticeable beyond 5 feet from the screen . Sound is quite good with lots of presence and decent bass . A steal at $ [ .. ] which is what I paid new .
  Contrary to the other review here these are actually excellent RAM coolers and are proven as such . ( Google it and read the reviews ) The 60mm fan runs slower and therefore more quietly and the angled bracket directs airflow towards the CPU , which even when water cooled , reduces the CPU temperature by 4 degrees . ( see - JonnyGURU review and others ) . I have another top brand RAM cooler that came supplied with the RAM chips and had to remove it due to excessive noise . I don't expect to have to do this with the Cool It solution however , especially with only one fan . I understand it has a blue led fan which will be perfect for some but restrictive for others with different colour schemes , but it might be worth checking that out because there may be a greater selection by now ? . For me that makes no difference as the bracket is the great thing about this device and I am happy to swap out the fan if and when the LED colour becomes an issue for me . Shame about the other poor review here as it 's completely misleading
  I had to buy this film for use in a photography class and it is a great film . The pictures develop great , the film is high quality , and it doesn't scratch too easy . Buy this film if you plan to develop your own pictures !
  I am disappointed by the sound quality offered by these headphones . Not only do they hurt your ears after wearing them for about 30minutes but sound like they should be $ 10 headphones . I feel like I paid for the Sony name and a flashy design . Some things I did buy them for , but I figured they 'd have at least as much bass as my freebie sonys that came with my walkman years ago . Otherwise the sound is OK , too much high and decent midrange . Nothing spectacular here . I will say that this style of headphone is about the best thing out there for any excercise routine . I 'm usually a Sony fan too , everything I own is sony . But unfortunately I shouldve gone with Koss in this department , they make behind the neck headphones also , and will in the future .
  I cracked open the case to see whats inside of the " noise filter " . Its an inductor ( LP filter ) on the ground wire ( ok good ) and the antenna signal wire , from your antenna , is NOT connected ! You see , its suppose to mount somewhere high on the dash and replace your antenna . Its own antenna , ( a little plate on the board I think ) , replaces your cars . I pulled in better AM stations since that is where I was getting all kinds of noise as expected . But I lost sensitivity on FM where my radio lost weaker FM sooner . I decided to remove it and just go back to check that all my grounding is ok . My car uses a back window strip , has less gain and more induced noise , instead of a pole antenna . I would buy it to improve some AM reception , but you must mount it high under or on the dash for it be effective . Mine came without instructions , it just has some writing on the bottom where a mounting board mentions mounting .
  the input banana plug isnt gold plated as shown in the picture although sound quality from this thing is still great .
  I got this camera because it was the most compact digital with 5MP . I knew it had a big LCD , but I 'm surprised at how useful this is . It 's so fun to take a shot and pass it around for everyone to see . The LCD is very sharp with good color and contrast . The screen is so much bigger than Sony 's DSC-P51 . I did find a very nice compact case which is rigid on the inside ( semi-hard ) to protect the LCD on eBay . Sony 's case is not very useful and defeats the purpose of the compact camera . Overall , I am very satisfied with the camera and I keep it in my pocket whenever I 'm out .
  My battery will run out much faster than my old canon battery after the first month .. now after 3 months it 's not even worth to charge it .. I can normaly take 5 pictures with a full charge of this battery .. No intence use at all .. just on weekends , barelly
  I 'm a mp3 player rookie . My son has a 30gb ipod and I 'd played with it . I got the Sansa e280 to listen to podcasts and music . As a music player it 's fine but I 'd like things to work differently when I 'm listening to a podcast . You can scan through a song ( or podcast in my case ) but only after poking around in the menus a little and if you stop scanning the player takes you out of scan mode after some brief time passes , so back to the menus I go to scan forward some more . I would love it if the big button changed the ring mode from volume to scan forward / back . I also wish I could bookmark a podcast . Syncing things up requires Windows Media Player 10 and I didn't want to upgrade to it , so I 'm stuck doing a clunky sync by hand , which I don't like much but realize that 's my problem until I upgrade to a newer version of Windows Media Player . I wish there was some other poor man 's sync software . When I first received this unit it would only come up in a mode to synch with Windows Media Player instead of the other mode that makes it look like a USB disk drive that you can drag files too . Had to search for a way to change this behavior and once I upgraded the firmware a new menu option appeared that allowed me to switch the connection mode back and forth . Note that the player came pre-loaded with some music that you can't see in the disk drive mode - strange . After a few weeks the Sansa didn't feel so clunky to me and I 'm enjoying it more .
  Bought it years ago , it seemed cool at first , then became too much trouble with not enough Navigation Buttons , Poor Touchscreen ( tactility , button options , choices , placement ) and HORRIBLE SOFTWARE NECESSARY TO PROGRAM . CHEWS THROUGH BATTERIES ! HOPEFULLY IT WILL NEVER BE MADE AGAIN .. AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS EVEN IF USED FOR NEXT TO NOTHING . IT REALLY SUCKS .
  I received these as a gift for my birthday and at first was like , " Crap . I don't need another pair of headphones . " I have a great pair of Aiwa earbuds , and a pair of Sony MDR-V700DJs , which aren't the most practical headphones for cruising round town . But , after giving the Logitech ' phones a listen for a couple of weeks , I 'm sold . They 're easy to use . They 're comfortable . I appreciate the option of connecting to my laptop , my stereo or my wife 's iPod . And , the battery life is surprising . I 've charged , taken them to the gym , then worked on my computer for several hours before needed to recharge . Nice . Soundwise , they 're great . Whether I 'm thrashing to punk ( TOP ) , jammin ' to dub ( JTD ) , zoning out to minimal ambient ( ZOMA ) or very , very carefully listening to Beethoven ( VVCLB ) , they put out the sound . The 20Hz to 20kHZ frequency response is decent ( the Sony 's are 5hz to 30kHZ ) , but my ability to roam around my apartment without the Bluetooth connection more than make up for the decreased response . Reading these reviews , I am bummed to read that people have had problems with the non-adjustable and breaking headband . I haven't had that issue ( and hope I don't ) . That 's a Logitech problem , and if they were smart , they 'd fix it proactively . Not taking care of it reflects negatively on the Logitech brand . All it takes is a few people to start blogging about it ( a la Kryptonite lock ) and they 'll take care of it .
  This is a nice camera case but is way too small for the Kodak DX7590 . I would not recommend this case for that camera .
  After 2 years my $ 5 pocket radio finally ' bit the dust ' ; so I was looking for an inexpensive radio to tuck in my fanny pack when I went out to the garden to work in the summertime and also to while away the time while I shoveled the driveway in the winter . While not able to find an affordable one at my local ' Mart ' stores - I checked online and found the Sony ICF-S10Mk2 pocket AM / FM radio and , after reading the various reviews , ordered two of them ( to save on shipping ) . Radio works fine on both the AM and FM stations I listen to , and the final price was about $ 12 each . I use the radio almost every day and am still using the original 2 batteries that were inserted about three weeks ago ; shipping was very prompt and actually arrived before time estimate given . I found what I was looking for at a price I wanted to pay and I 'm very pleased with my purchase !
  I really liked the idea of this item ; as small as a flash drive , big enough capacity for working out or the commute , but when it came time to getting it to work with the new iTunes , no luck . The product * thinks * it works with iTunes but if the computer won't support the product , there 's not much you can do about that ! Had to send it back .. but I still LIKE the idea . If you 're on PC I 'm sure it 's fabulous .
  I bought this radar because every weekend i drive 30 miles back and forth between my college and home . Its a horrible , long and boring , drive for 36 miles with nothing but highway . I wanted to get one of these so I could just go a little over 70 and make the drive more bearable . The problem is that before I bought one of these , I was already driving 70 , 80 , and sometimes 90 on the highway and no cops were even there to get a reading . I tried this out and it never gave me any warnings . In town , the stop lights made it beep and light up , but that is not what I am concerned with . Perhaps it works great in other states but the police do not really patrol as hard here , so essentially this was a waste for me . Not saying the device is bad , but after getting it I realize there is barely any cops to even use this on where I live ( long island ) . When I do see people get pulled over , its usually for drunk driving , I always see people doing 90 without any trouble . Perhaps I will update this in the summer when perhaps more people are speeding and cops are able to sit on the highway for a while ( instead of winter and fall ) .
  I 've been using it for several years until the rechargeable battery died , so I can't use it anymore without plugging in at the AC socket . I sent an email to Logitech support but they told me that they cannot replace the battery nor repair the unit because they no longer supported it and its already out of warranty . So I vowed that I will never buy another logitech product again .
  Okay . I admit to not expecting a great deal from this camera , but I was really hoping for the best . It 's difficult to use the digital part , but the instant pictures were fun ! I finally gave it to the kids to play with . They love to practice , but have yet to take a good digital picture . Much more of a toy than useful camera .
  the software seems to have compatibility issues with what is on my computer . It often malfunctions , causing me to have to reboot . The internet will cut out for no reason , and there is no guaranty that rebooting will restore it . Sometimes I can get it to work again by disabling it and re-enabling it , but that too is sporadic . Can't something just " work " ? I 've had it unplugged for the last couple weeks , unsure that it will even work as an unpowered usb hub ( because the software won't let it ) . No instructions on how to uninstall the driver and I can't seem to find it with Window 's add / remove program utility .
  I read all the great reviews and I bought this DVD player for my fianc & eacute ; last year for Christmas . We were moving and didn't even take it out of the box until March . We 're busy people so I 'd say we watch about 3 movies a month on it .. If you 're going to buy a Philips make sure to get the extended warranty or go with a good brand like Sony .
  The battery lost power after only a few weeks of powering a weather station whose original battery lasted 6 months .
  ok , but Don't works with the JVC AVX2 , I must to make an exchange with other radio ..
  This DVR is great for the cost . It is pretty easy to set up & use . Don't set the DVR for Progressive , most TV 's are not & you are stuck with sound & no picture . Tech support via e-mail is helpful but just call to get quick friendly service . I still have lots to learn .
  This unit replaced an OPTI ES1500 . It doesn't get warm , does not buzz when it wants to , has a small footprint , and lots of outlets , some just surge . It includes the easiest software I ever installed . Price was right . About the highest surge capacity [ Joules ] for this type [ home / small office ] ups . Permanently attached input cord eliminates the occasional AC disconnect - when unit hot or moving it around or the errant foot snagging the wire . The LCD screen provides all necessary input / output data instantly , rather than opening the software . Been using battery backups / ups for 24 years and this is the best all ' round unit I 've used . I would recommend this ups to anyone who needs high capacity or extended run time . Cyberpower CP1500AVRLCD UPS - LCD Display 1500VA / 900W AVR 8-Outlet RJ11 / RJ45 / Coax Tower USB
  i took it home , plugged it in , and you could hear a loud hissing noise from up to 4 feet away . just awful .
  This item worked for about two weeks . It transmitted pretty well at a range of about 6 feet , but not very well at greater distances . After two weeks , the product died and never worked again . I 'd recommend going with a different transmitter .
  Pack i received was worthless , doesn't stick well enough to sink which made it impossible to take off the wax paper . Went back to using arctic silver , tricky to get a smooth even layer , but it is easier to use . No more pads for me , and i won't recommend these to anybody else .
  I was very pleased with the purchase of this product . The only thing that I was disappointed with was the screen size that the bracket would hold .
  For some reason I expected this thing to be heavy , but it wasn't , and it works like a charm for my laptop . It works pretty well on any surface . I use it all the time , because I hate to use laptop mouse pads . All I can say is that it works really well and it 's cheap .
  I am sitting here spending more time on this printer because it is more important for me to take away money from HP than do something else in my life . This printer , when I first received it , was giving me print head errors when I first got it . I called HP and they immediately sent me a replacement unit . I THOUGHT it was simple a good support policy , but what they did NOT reveal was the replacement was due to the fact these printers almost always fail , due to defective parts and engineering . I just wasted another $ 180 on print heads because I was told I could either buy a support contract or buy print heads . This machine does not have defective print heads . It has defective sensors that cannot be replaced . Do not buy this printer . Consider Epson .
  My headphones worked well for about 1 month and then they came off the plastic hinges where they attach to the earmuff . There is a screw that supposedly keeps it in place but it is so flimsy that this broke within 1 month of use . DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM
  these cables i received are a cheap chinese knockoff . although they do work they are cheaply made and am wondering for how long . As the saying goes " you get what you pay for " but this is nothing less than false advertising .
  I bought one of these a few weeks ago to use for presentations to clients while on the road . During the first week , I loaded all of my data and tuned my settings on this computer . I noticed that this thing was slow to boot up , and was also slow at times to respond . The next week , one night before a rather large presentation , I started the computer to double check my Power Point show and tell . Less than 5 minutes after I began the computer DIED . I had it for only 10 days ! The computer had never left my house ! Thank God it happened so soon . Otherwise I would have been stuck with it . The Good : What little time I had it , The graphics were pretty good , Nice sized Keyboard , Good viewing angles . The Bad : It was SLOW to boot up and died a young death after 10 days .. Let me demonstrate in words how slow it would run . I have an iMac G3 600Mhz that has a copy of Virtual PC Windows XP Home Edition . The iMac was almost as fast as the Gateway . No joke ! The difference in boot up was within 30 seconds of each other . Opening " My Computer " in XP took the same amount of time on both machines . Ask any Mac user , Virtual PC for Mac is NOT a high performance utility . It 's painfully slow . Even more painful on a G3 chip ! When using the Gateway , I thought , " I cannot believe how slow this is " . I believe it is safe to assume that there was a major flaw in the Gateways CPU . Intel and AMD make very respectable chips , and I believe that this one was sick out of the box . Bottom line : I will not buy another Gateway . Sure these things happen , but I am self employed . I cannot take a chance on another one doing the same thing . This one was the first and the last . I also have 2 friends and 1 sort of friend that have had very bad experiences with Gateway PC 's . I gave them a chance , and they lost . UPDATE * Thanks for the " Not Helpful " votes guys . As stated above , I only had this for 10 days . Total running time was under 6 hours . Of that 6 , 4.5 hours was used to create a Power Point Presentation . The rest of the time was spent setting the computer up for my business needs . 6 hours was not enough time to generate a " Positive , Raving , Praising Techno Nerd review . However , It was long enough to learn the hard way that this machine was JUNK . The entire purpose of posting this review was to warn people that might not have the financial means to buy anything outside of this price range . Someone out there might be looking at this as a computer to send with their son or daughter to college . They might not be able to afford to replace it if it dies a couple of weeks later . Bottom line : Be safe and look at other brands in this price range . Check the reviews and see if they are rated any better before going out on a limb . * UPDATE 2 * Well , Well , Well , It seems that Gateway has stopped making this . One might wonder why . Could it be because this thing is a P.O.S ? I think so .
  Setup was a snap , file copy was adequate and ran a full Norton Ghost backup ( about 150G ) without a hitch . Copied the files to the device from a Vista machine , extracted them from an XP machine . There was something that sounded like a little screw rattling around inside the casing . It arrived that way and I 'm going to assume that it didn't shake loose during shipment , but was the result of an inadequate QA process . I returned it and will probably look for a completely different brand since I don't trust SimpleTech now - as a company .
  I 'm satisfied with the value and quality . Enjoy your system if you select Polk for your home entertainment video / sound system .
  USED THE MACHINE WONDERFULLY FOR 2 WEEKS , AND THEN IT DEVELOPED A TERRIBLE SMELL FOR A DAY AND THEN WAS DOA THE NEXT MORNING . I WAS USING THIS AT A BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB , SO IT WAS A REAL BUMMER WHEN IT QUIT . I WILL SAY THAT I RECEIVED AN ABSOLUTELY NO HASSLE REFUND , BUT I THINK I AM GOING TO MOVE AWAY FROM APEX .
  This is a a very fine MP3 player . It works as avertised . Downloads music quickly and I enjoy listening to music via the internet radio and full albums without having to download them . This is a great system for the person who loves to listen to all types of music and doesn't mind paying the 14.95 a month to continue with this service . Well worth it to the person who usually spends this much or more buying CD 's or downloading music at 99 cents a song . Great price also at under $ 90
  I bought this , with the hope that it would be able to jump start my car if needed . I had been having some battery problems , so I bought this . I charged it as the directions indicated in the User 's Guide directed , then I checked it and it displayed 100 % full . I needed to jump my battery and I followed the directions in the User Guide , and it would not work . The light came on on the powerpack , BUT it would not jump start my car . I returned it , and will try another one . I might have gotten a defective unit , and I realize that , but I will not be buying another one of these from Xantrex .
  It works great . The material is quite much more durable than the cables you would buy at your nearest electronic or commercial electronic store .
  This is a duckbill platypus of a phone . Paper weight , chew toy , vibrator ? Maybe . Phone ? Forget about it .
  I 'm a software developer . I 'm on my computer all day and I wear headphones so that I can ignore what 's going on around me . I hate having to manage the headphone cord , it 's always getting caught on things . So I decided it would be a good investment to buy some wireless headphones . I looked around a bit on Amazon and noticed that these headphones had over 500 reviews and was rated at 4 stars , pretty good I thought . So I ordered them . But when I got them set up with the receiver literally about 18 inches from my head I got static and high pitch squeaking . I really did try ALL the troubleshooting options Sony details in their troubleshoot guide that come with the headphones . The suspicious thing is that there are about 15 different things Sony suggests that may be the source of bad performance from the headphones .. why are there so many ? Nevertheless , none of the fixes worked , and sadly I realized I would now have to go through the hassle of returning the headphones for a refund . Fortunately , Amazon has an awesome return system / policy and I got my money back . So I 'm back looking for another set of wireless headphones . I don't recommend buying these headphones .
  SilverStone Aluminum Front Panel 5.25-Inch Multi-media System with LCD Display MFP51B ( Black ) SilverStone Aluminum Front Panel 5.25-Inch Multi-media System with LCD Display MFP51S ( Silver ) I normally don't write reviews but in this case I would like to prevent other people from having to deal with the headache and frustration purchasing this will certainly cause you . Let 's start from the beginning . Unit : When you go to install this unit you won't be able to rely on the instructions alone as they are very vague and short , also the pictures are of very poor quality and hard to make out . Installing may seem a bit difficult , but trust me that was a walk in the park compared to getting this thing to actually work right . Once I got it installed and powered on I noticed my display screen was crooked . I could see a large white gap on the right side and half way down the bottom middle leading to the right . I wasn't pleased to say the least but I removed the screws and housing and aligned the screen back into place . The method they used for holding it in place is very poor , ( 4 thin plastic tabs in the corners ) This allows it to slip out of place very easily . The display is nothing like the pictures you see , it 's not a vivid blue color it 's more of a washed out purple . The remote is not what 's pictured either , it 's not black / silver it 's all black and very lightweight . Software : Installing the software is as easy as it should be , however getting it to work is an impossible task . It comes with old outdated iMON / iMEDIAN software and requires you to update after installing . After the update all should be well right ? Nope .. not even close , you 'll be lucky if half of the stuff works as it should . In my case power on and power off does not work , none of the webcasting works , onscreen keyboard won't even display , half of the mouse functions don't work , weather option is limited to few selected big cities ( as far as the U.S. is concerned ) , graphic eq only works in certain modes . The only things that do work without error are the option to scroll news and system information . You would think after all the complaints I 've seen in their user forums and problems customers have , the company would come up with solutions and put out a product that works . Several years of development seem to have only confused the developers and some updates fix one solution while rendering other working functions useless . On top of all this the software puts an annoying icon on your desktop that can only be reduced in size but not removed . To sum it all up , I would not recommend purchasing this unit or any other unit ran on the iMON software .
  This wireless PCI card was included in a custom computer I recently ordered , but I felt I should review it on here so others could get a feel for it . Installation : Like most PCI cards , this device was a breeze to install . You simply open up your case , and plug it into a PCI slot . The antennas easily attach to the back of the card , and the wire is around 3-4 feet in length . For most purposes , the length should be good . Once the hardware was in , the OS ( Windows 7 ) automatically loaded the correct drivers , and I was surfing the web in no time . I also installed the Linksys drivers , and had no problems with them . Again , I was using Windows 7 Ultimate x64 . Drivers were a little more difficult with Linux . Both Backtrack 5 and CentOS gave me troubles , forcing me to use Ndiswrapper . Others distributions like Xubuntu loaded the " proprietary " drivers for me , and simply required a reboot . Features : I really like the fact that the antenna is extended with a wire . I previously had a PCI card with the small 3 " antenna , but had problems with range , since the they sit in the back of my computer . With the wire , I can pull the antenna to the top of my desk , where I get great reception and range . The fact that it supports wireless N is great , since this means it can transfer data many times faster than wireless G cards . However , this really only matters if you have a wireless N router . If you don't have this type of wireless router , than this won't help much . Performance : This card performs just as it should . It has excellent range , and I 'm picking up networks I 've never seen before . It has no troubles getting signals that travel through 5-6 walls to reach me . The transfer speed is great , and I seem to be limited right now by the speed at which my router is transmitting . When I upgrade to a wireless N router , I will likely see a HUGE increase in speed , since it will be able to transfer data at 2 frequencies instead of 1 . Overall : At $ 110 , I 'm not going to lie , this is an expensive card . There are others you can get for $ 50 that have the wireless N capability . However , where this card shines is in it 's range and reliability . I wasn't too impressed with the card 's comparability with Linux . I 'd say the bottom line is that this is a good card if you 're willing to spend the money , but there are cheaper cards that I 'm sure perform just as well . If you plan on using Linux , know that you 're going to spend some time messing with drivers . Overall , I took off a star due to the price . The compatibility issues with Linux aren't really Cisco 's fault , although I would have liked to see an open source driver out there .
  I use these in an office environment for patch cables . Nothing fails more than a homemade network cable , so this fit the bill just perfectly . Easy to jack in and unjack , easy to unravel , and the category 6 to match what we have in the walls . Completely satisfied with performance .
  Digital cameras are in and disposable cameras are out . The Kodak Easyshare camera DX7440 says just how easy it is in the title . This phenomenal camera has brought pictures to awhole new level of quality and will have an individual wanting to take more and more pictures than ever . The sixteen automatic scene modes programed on this camera have made the quality of my pictures sky rocket . Modes such as " objects in motion " to " distant scenery " create anexcellent picture quality . The fact that there is a long lasting battery gives the individual time to pick which mode they would like to use ; it 's not a race against time . Disposable cameras on the other hand tend to be a " pain in the butt . " The only option an individual has is to have a flash or not have a flash . Also , there is no substance or quality to the picture . An individual does not have the option to look at their picture on an lcd screen opposed to the Kodak Easyshare camera , which provides an excellent screen . The best feature Kodak Easyshare camera provides is the " movie mode . " There are a total thirty-two mega bites available for personal recording . This product providesvideo recording , saving individuals the hassle of using both a camera and a camcorder . Whenever there is a movie someone would like to delete , it can be deleted with the click of abutton ; pictures can be deleted as well . On the other hand , disposable cameras only provide pictures ; movie options are not available . Also , pictures can not be deleted from a disposable camera . Another available option that comes equipped with the Easyshare camera is picture sharing . This easy to use program comes right with the camera , along with a touch up program to fix red eye problems . This process takes seconds depending on the total amount of pictures stored on your camera . There is one cord that connects a camera to the computer allowing each picture to be stored on any computer . Two-hundred pictures can be stored on the camera at one time . Purchasing a digital camera saves an individual time by emailing pictures to friends opposed to copying them on a machine and then sending them through the mail . This process is costly and inconvenient . A digital Camera is expensive , but worth the money . Digital cameras save a person time and money , but also gives a person the choice to delete what pictures they do not like . The Easyshare camera is an easy camera to operate ; I wouldn't recommend any other camera to a first time user .
  This item is terrible . Microsoft has yet to release a product for the car that actually works . I have tried multiple products and nothing works . DO NOT buy this item . I love my zune but the car pack works very poorly playing mostly static on all stations . You are better off to save your money .
  Good morning , dear Amazonthis cd player never worked , only radio , and one radio digital vie its not posible , please this articles are not recomended to never in the life . okme buy two radios an sorry , not more radio .. please checked every radios in warehouse .. thanks .. alberto baez ..
  I don't have very much desk space for a printer and wanted something small for printing photos . I originally bought a Canon i560 but returned it because it was too big . This printer is nice and small . Doesn't come with a USB cable and I forgot to order it when I ordered the printer ( Doh ! ) so I had to buy one at CompUSA for $ 25 . Prints beautiful photos from the memory stick , and when the USB cable is attached to your computer , you can use the memory stick reader on the printer to transfer photos into your computer . I had to reinstall the OS before I could get it to print with Mac OS 10.3 : Panther . I tried loading the latest drivers from the HP website ( 2.3.7 ) and it didn't work . Finally did a clean install of the OS and was able to get the printer to work with my Mac .
  I will reiterate what so many others have and I hope Creative Labs will read this : I purchased this unit 3 weeks ago at CompUSa . After one week the play button stopped working so I took it back toCompUsa and they replaced it with another one . Guess What ? It stopped working too after only a week of playing it . This thing is a piece of crap . I 'm left with a glorified floppy unit and not an MP3 player .
  I bought it for my 17 inch notebook and worked fine . Has too many compartments , but is a bit bulky because when empty it will sag a bit and wish it had one of those straps around the bag itself so that it wouldn't sag . Carried a ton of things in it and after my 1st trip thought that some of the stitches would slowly be stretched , or some compartment inside tear a bit , but nope , this product is sturdy enough . Its outer compartment again sags because the strap for it could have probably tightened it a bit more . I carried a projector , my camera bag ( which in itself had an slr with lenses , digital camera , card reader , camcorder , tapes etc ) . All in all it carried a lot of things and still was compact enough for the people at the checkin counter not to bother me with the size or weight . The bag sags a little which is why I gave it 4 stars though can't blame it for the fact that it has so much space in it . If you want something really compact then you should chose something smaller .
  This sucks . It was supposed to come withsome squirter fluid but it didn't . I had to order the sspray separetly
  the singal of the cable is not losing any of its picture quality but the software is poor and unstable . Other than that it is a great product .
  I know Vaio 's have a good name overall . But the FRV31 does not live up to the Sony name . The performance of the 2.4GHz Celeron processor is slower than a 1.8GHz Celeron proc on a desktop system . Oh , and the advertising material on this model is incorrect in saying the processor has 512kb of L2 cache . It only has 128kb of L2 cache . But , that 's not the worst part . The battery life is only 50 - 55 minutes , tops ! That 's without any thing else connected to it . Sony 's repair center kept my laptop for a few days , they said they ran some battery tests which all passed . Returned my laptop without any repair saying no problem found ; must be a software issue . Of course , it still only runs for 50 mins before battery runs out . Have called Sony since then , only to find out that they only warranty batteries for 30 days . They recommend that I purchase another battery . NO way , a customer should have to spend [ more money ] on some thing that should be under warranty . Based on my experience , I would recommend you spend your money some where else . So far , I 've found FRV31 to be a sub-standard product and a Sony support team which is NOT willing to resolve the problem .
  THIS IS A GOOD CARD AT A VERY RESONABLE PRICE . THE CARD MADE MY GAMES RUN ALOT BETTER .
  Brother 's technical service has gone from excellent to terrible . The first few times I called , I got extremely knowledgeable and helpful people . Then my paper started jamming . I would call for help and end up running through a long exercise with each person , to no avail - a total waste of time . Then the jamming kept getting worse . I left a message for a supervisor . He called me a couple of times and got my answering machine . He didn't leave his direct number . So I called tech support again but got the Philippines . They wouldn't give me that supervisor 's number or his e-mail address . They kept telling me to call the same number and hope to get his office . But I kept getting the Phillippines , each time with the same lack of help . They wouldn't give me any U.S. phone number . So I called directory assistance and got the U.S. phone number . I called it , and again ended up in the Phillippines with another dead end . So I tried their website , which offers the ability to send them an email . But it 's fake ! It just leads you to FAQs !
  The product here is even less reliable and more chintzy than the product description suggests , but that 's a good thing : the idea here is that you don't quite know what you 're going to get . It 'll often turn even the most banal snapshot into something interesting . Not a good introduction to medium-format , though ; start with a pro camera and pick this up for fun .
  This filter is great and I leave it on my camera 24-7 . When I need to switch to a polarizing filter , I just screw that filter on and leave the haze-2A on . Not only does it keep your pictures crystal clear and crisp , but it also protects your camera . I do think it does affect your pictures more than the Haze - 1 filter as far as blocking out Uv rays , but for this price , it 's worth it . Great to protect that expensive lens or even that inexpensive lens on your camera .
  I bought this cable to use it at my work place after reading the reviews , but once i received it and tried connecting it to the PC / wall charger , it does not work at all . On the PC it says , the USB device is not recognized . I 'm not sure if this is just a bad one . But i would not recommend as it is a waste of time buying and trying it out .
  This USB Tuner does exactly what it should do and does it well . Switching channels is very , very fast . Although it does run quite hot , it hasn't been a problem . Combined with EyeTV 3 , this is the best PVR solution I could find for such a price .
  Very good quality pictures although it could really use a flash or light . I was never able to get the web cam driver to work properly but it was a good camera for regular pictures . Battery life could be better but just get rechargeable AA batteries always carrying a spare and you 'll be set .
  I bought the TV new . Pros : 1 ) Best picture I have ever had . 2 ) Amazing experience watching TV . 3 ) Loved this TV and everyone who came by the house commented on how good the picture was . 4 ) Best 18 months of watching TV everCons1 ) Used the warranty after the first 6 months when the TV stopped working . 2 ) One year later TV not working again ( won't turn on ) Samsung 1-800 technician tells me it is out of warranty protection . 3 ) Most expensive TV I have ever owned . 4 ) 18 months later need a new tv .. can I borrow some money !
  It was worth a shot for the price . But this antenna extension doesn't seem to pull in SW signals any better than the telescoping antenna on my Realistic ( Tandy ) DX-370 alone , at least when strung indoors . The product is well-made however . This antenna extension might work better with different SW frequencies than the ones on the DX-370 ( 3.2-7.3 MHz and 9.5-21.75 MHz ) .
  Stay away from this product , It 's EVIL ! This unit is completely useless . It crashes even with full power while doing a simple Note or Word document . Pictures jpg , gif , or any other format , ( Even with installing the companion software for it ) , look atrocious . It has to be re-synced and given a new name on your computer after each restart with the battery switch . This cannot be relied on in any way shape , or form . The only good reviews written on it are : 1 ) Paid for by Toshiba . 2 ) Written by someone who thinks they know what you did wrong , ( It is not you ) . 3 ) By someone who wants you to suffer as they have . Along the lines of always trying to stay positive here are some good things about it : 1 ) The unit has no issues when powered off . 2 ) It makes an attractive paperweight . 3 ) Can be used to pound thumbtacks into the wall . 4 ) It can be used as a fly swatter . 5 ) Makes a great Rug-Hockey puck . 6 ) It 's handy dandy as a Windshield Ice Scrapper .
  I am a fan of Polk speakers and these lived up to my expectations . I was told 30 years ago , when I got my first Polks , that for soft rooms Bose was best and for hard rooms , Polk . I always have had hardwood floors , very little upholstered furniture and minimal other things like drapes that suck up the sound . The Polks are perfect for this . I 'm no audiophile but I am very sound sensitive and I like clean sound . These have it and they are beautiful to look at . The image doesn't show this well but the speaker covers curve away from the body of the speaker and are very elegant looking .
  I have been using this card reader for over a year , and it 's never had any problems . It 's the easiest thing to use and I highly recommend it .
  I wish I could say these sounded as good as a pair of " high-end " cables from Target . They sounded much MUCH worse . The entire midrange was muddy , cymbals almost nonexistent . The soundstage just seemed so one-dimensional , I couldn't believe it . The bass response didn't seem like it changed .. This was hooked up to an upgraded Rega RP1 turntable with a Cambridge Audio 640P preamp to an Onkyo TX-SR706 receiver . I did A / B testing with my boyfriend around as a control , and he also noted everything I just mentioned , so it wasn't just me . I wasn't hoping for much , but I was definitely EXPECTING these to sound better . Disappointing , to say the least . I am actually surprised that you can hear a difference in RCA cables over such a short span of distance . Oh , and when I plugged one of the cables in , it broke my input plug on my receiver , so I have to use a different one now . Be aware of this when if you do end up buying these and jiggling them . In Monster 's defense , they advise you to twist the plug onto the input , but , I didn't think it would be as hard as it was . Buyer beware !
  I originally bought the 401 but exchanged it for the 205 as the 401 was much too complicated for my purposes . I also found that the HDMIs on the 401 are for convience ( fewer cables ) and does not make any noticable improvements over component connects . When I up-grade to HD-DVD I can still run an HDMI into my LCD-HDTV with a digital audio out to the 205 . The 205 does not have all the extra features of the 401 but it performs just as well . I use the 205 for surround in my bedroom driving 7 JBL sats and sub . It doesn't seem to have quite the power of my living room Panny XR55 ( driving big athenas and sunfire sub ) but it still does the job remarkably well . I do think it 's more attractive than the panny , more compact and costs less . It gets warm but so did the 401 . The remote is small but I had planned to buy a Harmony universal anyway so it was a non issue .
  With my big hands , its hard to find a comfortable mouse . The standard ones give my hands cramps . This one isn't terribly big , but contoured enough to be good for me . Everything else works just fine too ..
  I have been photographing professionally for 36 years and virtually all 35mm in my inventory is Canon , so I am more than aware of the quality optics which they can produce . However , this is patently the worst lens I have ever seen Canon roll off the assembly line . Even at the higher shutter speeds ( 1/1250 ) and on a tripod as well , this lens lacks any degree of sharpness . Do NOT purchase this lens unless you 're an absolute Novice and will be photographing the family pet romping in the backyard . Save you money and go with a higher-end model .
  All the useful features of the Casio Phonemate TA-119 Answering Machine and Speakerphone prompted me to purchase it and try it out . While most of the features would normally be useful they are very difficult to use . Programming the machine with multiple greetings using the greeting file was a difficult task thanks to the poorly worded and often confusing instructions . Switching from one greeting to another is even much more difficult . Switching the greetings evolves several steps and its actually easier to just record a new one each time the greeting needs to be changed . Furthermore , the greetings sound quality is very poor . One could find many of the same features as in this machine without the useless greetings file for much less . I wouldn't recommend this answering machine for this reason .
  Based on other reviews I went ahead and purchased the iHome iH5 Clock Radio and was not impressed to say the least . I didn't think the sound was that great and there was no bass . Ended up returning it and for $ 199 got the Klipsch IFI which is worlds better . I am very satisfied with the Klipsch .
  As expextedAsking me to write more than this is nwasting your time and mine because no explinations are neccissary
  Great price and ink - Good by ink stress ! Don't worry about printing something because it may not be worth the ink and replacement ink is expensive . No More ! Go ahead and give them a try . I have an older printer and considered replacement but gave this cartridge a try . Glad I did .
  This product will not work with any other OS except Windows XP Media Edition 2005 . It won't even work with Windows XP Pro SP2 with the Media Connect patch . I 'm taking it back .
  I bought this camera because it was advertised to be Mac compatible . Unfortunately , it only works with Mac OS 9 and below , which haven't been produced since 2002 or so . Also , the design of the camera is such that you have to place it at eye level ( it doesn't pivot up enough ) and yet there 's no way to attach it to a laptop . So you have to place it on top of a pile of books or something to have it angle correctly . Too bad . I was hoping it would be an inexpensive camera to use in talking with my husband overseas .
  We bought this nifty gadget before HDMI really started to take off . It is constructed very well . It does not feel cheap at all . We had it for about 5 years and the picture and sound came through great on our home system . I dont know if I 'd recommend this now though because there are switches that offer HDMI amongst other connections and cost about the same or cheaper . But if you can find one used and cheap I 'd say GO FOR IT !
  It 's fairly large , can fit my regular camera in it as well as the camcorder . Been working good so far .
  I was ready to purchase fairly expensive , high-end authoring software for converting vinyl into CDs until I read a review on this product . While it is not ' no manual needed intuitive ' , it has incredible features and does an excellent job at cleaning up albums for conversion to CD and is a lot easier to use than other products I have demoed . My main complaint is that when I upgraded to the next version , I did not get the upgrade discount and after sending 3 emails to customer service not a one of them have been answered . I even posted a complaint on their forum and that went unanswered . Don't expect any customer service , but the product is worth considering - definitely .
  I use this printer to print pictures off of my digicam exclusively . Thus far , I haven't had any problems , with loading or otherwise . If you look at the specifications , the only difference between this printer and the 1215 is a matter of memory . The picture quality is decent . And you can't beat the price . Overall , a very good buy .
  a ) Although Amazon 's website says the model number is MP502B , you will not receive that . The model you get is a MP501BL ( which is what you want . ) Per my phone conversation with VideoSecu : MP501B and MP501BL are the same model ( two different ( but valid ) model numbers for the same product . ) MP502B has a two-piece backing plate . b ) Amazon 's website also says " please report to Amazon . com if you receive a mount without VideoSecu logo . " . Per my phone conversation with VideoSecu : The VideoSecu logo is only required to be on the shipping box , and is not on the product itself . HTH ! I will update this review if there are any installation problems . Update : No installation problems . If you want to use the tilt feature or you have to plug in RCA ( red-yellow-white ) cables ( for older , non-HDMI VCRs / DVDs players ) , recommend you set those up you put the TV on the mount . ( Once it 's installed , I can't get my hand back there to plug in cables , or use the tilt . ) Another update ( VideoSecu e-mailed me ) : " This product had been revised by the designer recently . MP502B is the revised model of MP501B . Basically they are same product , same function , same loading capacity . MP502B has more flexibility , and accommodate more TVs than MP501B since it is 2 piece design . Customer has the option to use only one piece when their TV is small , or mount 2 piece apart when necessary . Other than that , they are the same . The videosecu logo is printed on the color box and on the brown box . It is not on the product . "
  Originally , I was somewhat skeptical ordering these given some of the other posters issue with these keys . These tools work fine to release and pull out a stock radio , given they are the correct keys for your car / radio . The first time I used them they worked perfectly , although a little tough to pull out . The second time they also worked fine but one did get stuck . I got it out pretty easily though with a light tap with a flat head screwdriver from the side of the radio to release it . In all honesty , if you canno't properly use these keys to get your stereo in and out ( and troubleshoot any minor issues these keys give you ) then you probably have no business pulling your stereo . This is the most simple part of any car audio process you may be looking to do yourself .
  This was my first digital camera . In fact , I still keep it around . In think is a pretty good and decent camera . It is easy to use and it is not heavy . Is perfect for vacations , party 's , and other activities . Ok , so the flash it is not so great . And it really uses up batteries rather fast . Anyway , I would buy it again if i could :D :D !
  Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1 : Lexar and SanDisk . I decided to buy Lexar . I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick . I have 2 cards : 128 MB and 1 GB . I had no problem with 128 MB card . But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader . It just did not go . I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success . It was a surprise for me . May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk .. ? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem . Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader .
  I purchase the drive so I can copy information on my computer at work and take it home and copy or alter it on my home computer which has Easy CD Creator on it . This drive came with software by Oak Technology " SimpliCD " . I have since found out that the formatting of the two systems are different and one cannot read the other . I would not recommend purchasing the drive if Oak Technology software is supplied . The actual unit maybe okay but the supplied software is not , at least for my purpose
  I was reviewing another item and this laptop popped up asking if I would like to review it . I purchased this in 2008 and I had it for such a short period I forgot about it . What a piece of junk ! It worked for about 3 months and then completely crashed . Terrible product ; do not buy , spend your money on something newer and better .
  Very easy to install and works quite well ! Light and very functional ! Gave new life to my Garmin GPS watch !
  I was drawn to this camera because of the special macro setting with a minimum distance from objects at 1.1 feet . It is specified as having a " smallest field of 6 inches " - but at 1.1 feet , the smallest frame is about 17 " wide . Out of focus close-up images happen about 40 % of the time - either because I was closer than 1.1 feet or the autofocus may be inaccurate at that distance . All these P & S ; cameras start out in 28mm wide angle mode - which naturally distorts the image ( at the edges especially and indoors as noted in other reviews ) . There is no way to find the " standard " 50mm setting to minimize the distortion , except to guess w / the zoom . These finer points should not discurage most users of this very sturdy camera . However , the zoom control is cramped ( if you use your left eye to focus ) , and it does take some time to find the image in the viewfinder , especially with a dark image in view . The camera endured 2 years of torture in the bottom of my bookbag . Maybe I 'll actually use the free softcase in the bookbag to provide more padding . It 's light enough to carry around all the time for those moments when you say " I wish I had a camera right now " . Good flash control . You must use the " landscape " setting if there is an object in the forground - or you get an image focused on the back of someone 's head .
  It did not work . So I called Hawking technical support and was told that it is not compatible with my printer ( Lexmark X83 ) . Tried to return it to the vender ( ANTOnline ) through the web RAM claim but they refused it . Talked to their customer support but they refused to discuss the RMA issue directly . Instead they told me they would review the decision but no response from them after 4 business days . BEWARE OF ANTOnline ! I filed a complaint to Better Business Bureau . About this print server , call Hawking tech . support before you order and make sure your printer is compatible . I was told by Hawking tech . support that they have a list of incompatible printers . HOWEVER THEY DON'T MAKE IT PUBLIC . And don't buy it from ANTOnline .
  I paid top dollar for the Top Of The Line Panasonic DVD Recorder & VCR Combo . This unit has the well-documented Panasonic EZ-series timer glitch . This glitch causes the unit to " forget " when timer recordings should start , so it fails to switch on and record either VHS or DVRs . I emailed Tech Support at Panasonic about this problem . They did NOT offer to replace the unit with something that works properly . They did NOT have a hardware / firmware fix . The best they could do was send me an Email detailing a sequence of button-pushes I should execute between every scheduled recording . I used to prefer to purchase Panasonic consumer electronics , and recomend them to others . This experience with a high-priced lemon has permanently soured me on Panasonic products .
  The cable works great , is long , and was cheap . I 'm thrilled with my purchase . I do not get any ghosting or poor image quality as a result of the length . I presently use this cable to display a 1680x1050 monitor from a computer in my attic .
  They look cool but I needed more than that in my wireless headphones . If anyone thinks these will sound like wired over the ear Sony headphones , they are kidding themselves . Other 1 star reviews nailed it , with static and horrible bass my biggest issue . I had no problem with the battery . This is yet another disappointing product from Sony that I returned . These should be bluetooth , how hard would that have been ? My Motorola Q9m and S9 headset sound superior to these at 15 feet , but alas I wanted something simple for the home . I took these back , got a Jabra A120s stereo bluetooth transmitter and $ 75 in change , it is still charging now but I 'll see how that goes .
  I read the bad reviews but I bought it , it worked for one week and died . Pure Junk , avaoid anything by Griffin .
  We were pleased not only with the product but also with the speedy delivery ! The price was also much better than what we found at other sites . When we are in the market again for a similar product we will certainly shop with you again . Thanks
  Just started using the battery pack . It bulks the camera up , of course , making a switch to a bigger camera bag necessary ( for me anyway ) , but I like the ease of use it brings . Used to have my right hand wrapped around the top of the camera for portrait-format photos , which became tiring after extended periods . Now my hand stays on the side of the camera , giving better control and stability .
  After a truly disappointing purchase of another mp3 player as a gift for a young sister this one came to my rescue . Obviously at this price you can't compare it to the iPod , but it works well and is easy to use . A great buy !
  I bought this for a Pentax K10D camera and it works just like it said it would in the add . good range from the front or back of the camera . Its nice to be able to take a picture without having to have a cord hooked to the camera I also have the wired remote witch you have to be right at the camera to use . the only thing about it is you have to take the remote apart to change the battery ( no door ) . I would say if you have a pentax K10D or the K100D buy this remote you will not be sorry . Also if you have the K10D get the battery box that fits on the bottom of the camera it holds a spair battery - Extra sd card and the remote . Amazon has all of them at a good price .

  First , I had Stylus C82 and it got clogged within 6 moths of purchase . Epson replaced it with new C84 ( 1 year warranty ) and it worked pretty well for about a little over a year . Got clogged again and it is out of warranty so I 'm out of luck .
  While they look great , the sleeves tend to break and tear near their binding . This causes the sleeves to fall out , which really defeats the purpose of a CD case . It looks great in the store but the real life functionality is only a 3/10 . Go with something that is really bound or has rings .
  Over the past three years , this little cloth has survived near daily use in myriad environments . I 'd give it ten stars if I could . I should get a few extras to keep in all of my various man bags .
  The GSC 10 uses two magnets to pick-up the speed ( magnet on rear-wheel spoke ) and cadence ( magnet on the inside of the left crank ) . The installation is pretty straight forward , although , the illustrations in the directions were not the most useful . The system has worked well so far . I have not been over the worst ' bumpy ' areas yet on my MTB but have been through some rough terrain and nothing came loose . The FR-305 is supposed to use the speed from the GSC 10 when it cannot get a lock on the GPS satellites . When MTB'ing , which many times involves making many small turns , the GPS mileage reading tends to be a little short . Thus it would be ideal of Garmin could somehow combine the readings from the GPS & GSC 10 to get a more accurate reading .
  This is probably the most capable camera you 'll find for $ 300 . For all the gory details , check one of the popular review sites . I 'll just mention a couple of pros / cons : Pros : 12x zoom , manual controls , AA batteries , remote capture capability and not least tilt & swivel LCD . It is so convenient , and it boggles my mind why so few cameras have this feature - not even high end ones . Cons : The lens cap is very loose and falls off all the time . Probably made so to prevent strain / damage to the lens motors if you forget to take off the cap before switching camera on ( I am certainly guilty there ) .
  Nothing but errors and coasters . Does not seem to properly write to DVD-R discs . Works fine for DVD + R , but will not work at all for DVD-R . Tech support at Iomega blamed the software company , the blank media and so on , but had no clue what was really happening . If you need DVD-RAM , stick to Panasonic , since they created it . For all others , just avoid this drive .
  This is my second Sony DVD player . I bought the first one two years ago , and it broke within two years . I bought the second one less than two months ago , and now this one is broken , exhibiting exactly the same malady . This is clearly a defective product . What 's worse is that Sony is notorious for terrible customer service , so I 'm probably out another $ 100 . I can surely say that this will be the last piece of Sony equipment I ever waste my money on . If you want a quality DVD player , you should probably look elsewhere .
  Great deal , I have a new one , and knew it was of great value , and buying this 1 used , made the deal even better , and will buy used in the future for sure
  This product is not for the faint of heart . If you like to spend long hours trying to make things work , then this is the one . I bought it tried it and returned it . It just would not work right on my PC . ( Win95 OSR2 ) I had to reboot 5 or 6 times everytimes to get my system to boot-up . It gave me . Registry errors , blue screens , missing files ( DLL ) , even tried the newer driver from Zoom , but it crashed my PC.I reformated C : twice . I really tried hard but my system just chocked on it . Once in a while it would work and it was pretty good but that never lasted long . I went back to my Telepath for windows ( 28K ) and upgraded it to V90 56k with one easy download .
  I Have been using the leather belt clip case for about three years now , since the palm pilot pro . Now that I have the palmII , it fit a little tight with the flip cover , but it loosens up in time . I use the loop in back with my belt . The belt clip is asking for trouble . The case can fall off your belt while entering your car or bending down . Also , heavier people usually don't like having the palm on their waist , it is too uncomfortable . It is the only way to go if you need your pilot with you all the time . It is harder to lose it when it is attached to you .
  Toshiba have managed to produce an excellent portable media player that offers a massive specification over rivals . If you have an interest in Windows Media Center 2005 / Vista Ultimate / XBOX 360 then this is the product for you as it is fully compatible with all and offers synchronisation of music , pictures , recorded TV and video . The display is very bright and clear and the sound quality from the head phones is great . This product would have got five stars if the USB connector was better and if it shipped with a protective case ! Wonder what the Zune will be based on ?
  I bought this because I wanted an inexpensive player that could play both DVD-A and SACD . There are maybe two or three players that fall in that category . At first , it seemed this player was the answer to my prayers . But then I started having issues with movies just stopping and then skipping entire chapters . Then it started doing it with DVD-A discs . To clarify , I take good care of my equipment and media . I always handle the discs properly and put them back in their case . There is not excessive dust in my house , and I do not smoke . It usually does this with the same discs , which have included brand new movies just being played for the first time . If I thought the problem would be solved , I would buy the 588A , but I 'm afraid to spend $ 100 + only to have the same issues . Perhaps I got a lemon with this one , but I have not been thrilled with Pioneer players ( my first player would pause at the layer change ) . I 've read reviews that the Yamaha C750 has better sound and is great for the price , but I 've also read about issues with that one as well . I just wish Panasonic had a player that could do what this Pioneer can do . I 've never had a problem with that brand .. ever .
  The product works fine as a one unit stand alone switch . I was attempting to controll 4 units simultaneously and was shipped 3 units on one frequency and one on a different control frequency . There was no way of ordering 4 alike and no way to reprogram the units . They should have DIP switches for flexibilty similar to ceiling fans or operable skylites .
  product is a lot bigger than what I expected but it works great for the dslr and 2 lenses . happy with it but the only thing is that it 's kinda bulky
  I purchased this case mainly for a trip to St . Lucia for snorkeling . It was wonderful ! Easy to put the camera in , and very easy to use . Took wonderful underwater pictures during snorkeling trips . My grandson ( 7 ) also has taken fun pictures with it in a swimming pool . Only thing I have to remember is to wipe the front of the case when getting out of the water before taking land pictures . Would highly recommend this even for rainy days and beach excursions .
  that cable is the solution to connect my Mac Book Pro to a HDTV , LCD ! the only thing is that I will need another cable to get the sound ! THe order was on time and the cable new ! Thanks !
  I don't own this so I can't comment on it 's functionality but you do not need this . As someone else mentioned already , Canon says the Pixma MP470 does not support other adapters ( I even contacted their support department ) but it is not true . After reading the aforementioned review , I tried my own Bluetooth adapter ( paid $ 8.99 ) and it worked fine-although , depending on your adapter , you may need a USB extender like I did .
  I don't know about some of the reviewers in here .. but why buy a subwoofer powered system if you 're scared of a little bass ? Yeesh .. Despite what the faint of heart say the bass is not _ that _ overpowering and compliments the satellites quite nicely . This is one of the best deals ive had with average consumer audio equipment . How can you go wrong for 30 $ ?
  I bought these around 2 years ago , and I 've been very pleased . I always get compliments on the aesthetic of the phones and that 's why you are buying them right ? They sound as good as you 'd expect from $ 40 headphones , not worse but not better . If you sweat and use them and leave them in the sun the cups will eventually crack , but then again I 've had mine for around 3 years now so it 's about time they get replaced . Lastly they will remain comfortable for around 5 hours which is really nice , people with smaller ears may have even greater comfort wearing themVery solid product , will buy some again once I find them again .
  A complete f * ^ king joke . I 'm a systems administrator and have been for a few years now and I cannot even get this to work . I had a D-Link which gave me minor trouble , but worked after only minimal tweaking , but returned it and bought the Belkin ON A NOKIA 'S TECH SUPPORT REP 'S ADVICE . Now that I 'm having trouble getting it pair with my Nokia 3650 , Nokia claims they never told me that ( BIG FAT LIARS ) . AT & T wouldn't help and neither would Belkin . Their tech support departments should be renamed to " Take your money and then play stupid and offer no help . " A complete waste of your hard-earned money . I repeat - DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU OWN A PC ! I repeat - DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU OWN A PC ! I repeat - DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU OWN A PC ! I repeat - DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU OWN A PC ! I repeat - DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU OWN A PC !
  What this camera can do is truly amazing . The photos are very well done with good focus , exposure , etc . It allows you to exercise your creativity to an extraordinary degree . The panoramic stitching software is superb . I have taken more than 120 photos at a time and still had power to spare . You should get a large memory chip ( 128M or 256M ) because the 8M is only good for 12-16 fine quality photos . Of course , it is a 2MP camera so you should not expect 13x19 prints but 5x7 or 8x10 are just fine . Panoramics are truly impressive - an 8x36 of New York City is stupendous . I am delighted with this in every way . It has exceeded all my expectations .
  I purchased the Sony Cybershot DSCS40 as a replacement for my Sony 2MP CyberShot - which was a workhorse of a camera ! The original CyberShot was much smaller and didn't have any zoom capability - but I would have purchased that camera over DSCS40 . * Size - the DSCS40 is larger than previous CyberShots - I am assuming to house the zoom lens . * Battery Life - pretty good - even when using a flash * Shutter speed - I disagree with most of the reviews here - If you are outside with sunlight this is a great camera with good shutter speed . If you are inside and the flash is needed , you are going to be waiting 3 seconds for the camera to focus . Once the flash goes off , start counting to 5 before you can take another picture . If your subject moves , add another 3 secoonds to refocus . Again , my old 2MP CyberShot performed better .. * VISIBAL LASER BEAM - No one else wrote about this . This is the first digital camera I 've seen that has a visial laser that shoots out to determine lighting and the focus . Pointing lasers at people 's eyes is always a bad idea . The camera 's manual says that the laser is " safe " but it recommends not aiming at people 's eyes ( interesting ) . If you have children , do not buy this camera because this laser is not a good idea . My previsous CyberShot and most other digital cameras ( high and low cost ) do not have this visial laser - why this camera does I 'll never know . * Zoom lense - nice feature to have - glad its there . However , if you use the zoom , you have to be extra stable before taking the picture or it will result in a blurry picture . * Picture Stability - The camera has no automatic picture stabilization - make sure you are solid before taking the picture - I have many shots that I deleted because I moved just alittle bit . This occurs even when not using the zoom . * Memory - I 've gone with the 3MP setting because the aspect ratio matches a 4x6 photo . * Flash - As stated above , it takes 5 seconds to recharge . Also , using the flash usually maeans the color will be whited-out ( i.e. , not great quality ) . * Picture Quality - Excellent when the lighting is good * Video - I haven't used it much - I pull out the digital video camera for that . * Price - Average camera for the price - This is a much better camera when outside in good lighting . However , it gets 2 stars because I expect more from Sony and for the price , there were better digital cameras I could have purchased . * Summary - My previous 2MP Cybershot left me with a great opinion of Sony 's cameras . The DSCS40 Cybershot has damaged that reputation . I will definitely check Sony out for my next camera , but the usually reliable Amazon reviews really missed the boat on this one . People giving this 4-5 stars must have had really bad experiences with previous cameras to give the DSCS40 such a high rating . I don't know else how to explain it . I will be sure to test the camera and not just go off of reviews before purchasing in the future .
  i got it and tried a whole night to lock the GPS signals , now i have to return it or get a replacement , what the quality control ! i checked some discussion group on web and found couples of similar issues happend . but anyway i need one to teach my daughter the sky knowleadge ..
  I was very pleased with the picture frame and the timely manner in which it arrived . It was for my friend for her birthday and she loved it .
  This is a great recorder and one of the most manageable . When recording interviews , I never have a problem with quality - not even when recording someone over the phone . The one flaw is the hard drive , but I can only hear it kick on when I am recording class lectures - otherwise it is inaudible . Perfect for aspiring journalists like myself !
  The instructions were next to incomprehensible , and if you have a projector that only mounts with 3 holes , there are no instructions on how to do it ( hint : you have to remove one of the mounting arms and re-mount in the center position ) . After I went through all of that , I found that the center pole was attached to the bracket at an angle and I could not loosen it to straighten to a 90 degree angle , and this made it next to impossinble to get it positioned correctly for the screen . This wouldn't have been so bad , but mounting bracket also has no yaw control ( horizontal rotation ) , only roll and tilt , which is not good for precise postioning . I ended up having to get an Optoma bracket ( more expensive ) to mount my HD20 projector .
  I purchased my DumbDumb 910 ( a . k . a . TomTom ) in Aug . 2006 for way too much money . This is the biggest , clunkiest , most expensive-yet worthless , piece of crap I 've ever bought . Do not waste your money on a frustrating piece of junk that has you literally driving in circles , freezes up , does not start up , takes forever to acquire a signal , and just shuts down for no reason at all . I am going to purchase one that costs much less and will be reliable ! It would be satisfying to smash this thing .
  Very sensitive to light . This camera has a mind of its own and you never know if you are going to get the shot . If you are outside it is to bright and you get a white picture , inside it is to dark . I have adjusted it and have seen other reviews that say the same . I am in the market for a new camera and it won't be HP !
  this is my first audiophile headphone , it sounds amazing ! at first i didn't know anything about soundstage , but after hearing my music , now i can understand what soundstage really means .. all of my music sounded much , much better and clearer with this headphone . playing FPS games ( ex . Battlefield Bad Company 2 ) is a blast , i can hear where enemy tanks are .. i don't really like it 's color but it 's OK .. With the price , and sound quality , i really can't say other than Amazing .
  The remote control is OK . But the earbuds are horrible ! They are very sensitive to your particular " ear anatomy " . I suppose they fit for some people , but for me they are useless . They stay in for a few seconds , but don't dare do anything like running , walking , or moving your head and expect them to stay in . Much better to get lightweight headphones with an over-the-head or behind-the-head band , or even the models with " hooks " that fit over the top of your ears .
  This is exactly what I needed . It was just perfect with excellent quality and gives the perfect range 18-200 . Eliminates carrying around multiple lenses . Very satisfied with the quality and it fits perfectly with my Sony Alpha .
  Estoy satisfecho con esta compra , el envio fue oportuno , el filtro trabaja satisfactoriamente , lo recomiendo ampliamente , el precio es muy competitivo
  i have yet to see any differences in any hdmi cords .. the only thing that makes one better than the other is which ever one you can get for the cheapest price . This cord has worked perfectly me .. and at a fraction of the cost of other name brand cords !
  I bought this card to replace my onboard audio which started to play an annoying buzz thru my speakers . All I can say is WOW ! The sound is so much clearer and stronger than before . There are many different sound profiles that you can choose from to change how the sound is heard ( for example , concert hall , heavy metal , jazz , etc ) in addition to being able to specify what type of speakers you have ( desktop , surround sound , etc ) . I installed this in about ten minutes ( including opening up the computer ) with no fuss whatsoever on a Win98SE machine . I uninstalled software for the onboard sound and then disabled it in the bios before putting in the new card so there would be no conflicts . There is a poster foldout that has diagrams and instructions for how to install along with a sidenote for WinXP users . It has the standard line-in , line-out , mic jacks along with a digital-out plug for Digital surround sound speaker systems or 3 plugs for an analog surround sound system . If you want to use the joystick port , it will require an additional slot being used . It comes with a digital and analog cable to connect to your internal CD-Rom / DVD-Rom . The big surprise is the FireWire port on the card . The box says you can use this for a computer to computer connection for gaming ( using FireNet software on the CD ) , but I see this as something you can use to connect to an external hard drive , digital camcorder or some of the newer portable music players . Some people complained about all the bloatware ( I can't really argue that point ) , but during installation you have the option to do a full install , drivers only install , or a custom install ( I did ) which you can pick and choose what you want to load on your system . This version also comes with the games Deus X and Giants : Citizen Kabuto .
  Although the box came all messed up , this product is still great ! I used this for my new thin Samsung flat screen and it looks beautiful . I say you dont need the newest or most expensive mounts out there but Sanus does make really good mounts .
  Bought this spindle 3 weeks ago have used about 19 of them and already have 6 that are no good non burnable . Forget this and go TDK .
  I have been through several headsets for use with computer and phone , so decided to go with something that should cover both . I can listen with comfort to computer or use to talk on phone withHeadset Buddy Adapter : PC Headset to Phone Adapter PC35-PH25 - Use Computer Headset with Home / Cell Phones - Convert Dual 3.5mm to 2.5mmand works great . I do wish had a microphone volume adjustment with certain calls it would be helpful to add additional volume . UPDATE 10/25/2011 BROKE JULY 2011After repeated use , knowing the microphone boom construction was plastic , I always treated with care . In the end , not with enough care , it broke at the base connection to earphone . Another annoyance to note after some use , when trying to adjust placement of microphone it never stayed in place , the flexible rubbery / plastic boom would not stay in one spot . Recently purchased another brand name that cost a little more than these , after a month of use with those I will go out on a limb and say will last considerably longer ( see more recent review of headphones ) . previous rating for this product was a 4 now down to a 2 for overall construction ( microphone boom overall ) .
  First of all , let & # 65533 ; s get this straight : the Sony MZ-N10 is NOT a top of the line recorder . It is mostly a music file transfer , storage and playback device . It does not come with a microphone ; therefore , recording sound with it as packaged is not possible . However , you can purchase a mic and use the unit to record , but the limitations are severe , as I & # 65533 ; ll explain below . You can record from any analog source but again with sever limitations . I will split my review into two parts : ( a ) hardware , ( b ) software . The hardware for the MZ-N10 is superb . The unit is unbelievably small and yet has both a feel and look of quality about it . The sound it produces is exceptional . The mechanical function of the unit is a little unorthodox and takes a while at the manual to master , but that & # 65533 ; s to be expected when packing so many features into such a small unit . The rotating & # 65533 ; Jog Dial & # 65533 ; also pushes laterally to navigate many features , and this may confuse you at first if you & # 65533 ; ve not seen that type of mechanism before . It comes with an attachable battery pack ( one AA , not included ) that should but does not have to be attached when in use . The pack does make it bulkier , heavier and more fragile . It attaches to the USP port , and the cantilevered pack if it should sustain a blow , could damage the unit & # 65533 ; s USB port . The connection of the unit to its power docking station ( also through the USB port ) is simple and positive . The computer USB connection is made through a second USB port on the docking station . All this hardware , including the attachable & # 65533 ; remote & # 65533 ; is well designed and functional . I & # 65533 ; ll be honest , I simply love the hardware . It is truly one of the marvels of 21st century technology . The software , called SonicStage , is another story . Why Sony calls many of the functions of the MZ-N10 & # 65533 ; recording & # 65533 ; is a puzzle until you read the manual on its operation . The process of transferring a music file from your computer into the device is called & # 65533 ; recording , & # 65533 ; a rather significant misnomer , in my opinion . In this mode the unit is a MUSIC transfer , storage and playback device . The manual talks exclusive of & # 65533 ; song & # 65533 ; transfer , and it calls the transformation process & # 65533 ; recording & # 65533 ; . When a song is transferred into the unit it is & # 65533 ; Checked Out & # 65533 ; . And when the song is returned to the computer , it is & # 65533 ; Checked In & # 65533 ; . While the song ( file ) is Checked Out it cannot be uploaded to another computer . The software blocks the transfer . The song can be played on the unit any number of times , but it can only be Checked Out three times . Another sever limitation comes if you want to create a CD . Here is the quote from the user & # 65533 ; s manual : & # 65533 ; In order to create your original audio CDs with SonicStage , you must use a Sony VAIO series computer only . The computer must be pre-installed with Windows XP and come with a recordable optical disc drive . & # 65533 ; Now for the recording problem . As I said above , you cannot record sound with the unit as packaged . You must purchase an external microphone to record sound into the unit . I purchased Sony & # 65533 ; s ECM-MS907 stereo mic . It works great . Another fine piece of Sony hardware . The mic plugs into the & # 65533 ; Line In & # 65533 ; port . The operation is then straightforward , and the recorded sound is crystal clear . You can use either a mic or record directly from any audio analog signal . Here & # 65533 ; s the problem . You cannot upload the recorded sound through the USB computer connection . The software is designed to block transfer ( say Check In ) of any sound files that have not first been Checked Out from the computer . I record animal sounds , bird calls , night sounds , and create sounds for website buttons , etc . I also import sound from my Yamaha keyboard . You CAN get the recorded sound into your computer by connecting a stereo wire from the unit & # 65533 ; s & # 65533 ; Line Out & # 65533 ; port to your computer & # 65533 ; s sound card . A very easy operation , but you must also purchase software that can capture the incoming sound . ( I use SoundForge . ) So the unit has digitized the incoming sound and then regenerates an analog signal to export it to your sound card . Your capture software then must re-digitize it . You have to adjust the sound using the volume control on the MZ-N10 . This is an unnecessary lossy process , and you will not get anywhere near as good sound as you would have if the software had permitted you to import the sound directly from the unit into your computer through the USB port . My results are terrible . You could have simply connected the analog device to your sound card and eliminated the two conversions inside the MZ-N10 . So the ability to record through an extra-purchase mic is a minor ( should I say bogus ? ) feature of the unit and should not affect your purchase decision one way or the other . In my opinion , the software cripples the function of this unit to the point where it is not worth the money . To call transferring digital sound files & # 65533 ; recording & # 65533 ; is simply not correct . All this software slight-of-hand has obviously been caused by the hysteria in the music industry over pirated songs . Hopefully Sony will quickly come to its senses and release another driver for this marvelous and expensive piece of hardware that will allow it to unfold its wings . It along with the Sony mic would be a miniature portable stereo recording studio par excellence in the field .
  As others have stated on here , these are NOT coated , and WILL cause light reflections on your images . I ruined several great shots because of this filter . I just returned it , and will just spend real money on a B + W multi-coated filter . If you are just getting this as a lens protector , I 'd recommend a lens hood instead .
  I found the manual poorly writen for me to understand . I also could not comprehend how to use the disc to rerecord . The old VCR was easy to use . I am sorry I ever bought the unit . All I wanted to do was record different programs to watch later in the evening . Maybe there are some other DVD recorders that are easier to use .
  Used this to upgrade RAM on my Gateway Convertible Notebook ( 210S ) . It was quick and easy to install , however , unfortunately my operating system ( 32bit ) Windows XP can only recognize 3GB total of the RAM . Not the fault of the memory though . It has speeded up my performance as I expected , so I am happy . Price was fantastic .
  Antenna that came with my card works much better than this one . I bought this liking the fact that it comes with a six foot cable for better placement but it doesnt matter due to the fact that this antenna lacks in being able to recieve signals .
  I got this digital camera about a week and a half ago , and I love it :) It takes great quality pictures , and good video , plus it 's really easy to connect and download pictures to my PC . All I have to do is plug it in to the USB cable and it pops up a window giving me the downloading options . The only problems I 've had with it are that it eats up batteries pretty fast , and if you take pictures without the flash or from really far away in low light conditions , the pictures can be a little fuzzy . However , they still show up . Overall , I 'd reccomend this camera :) It 's great , and I can take it anywhere .
  The benefits of having a custom-fitted case for your Sony Cyber-Shot digital camera are probably too obvious to mention , but here I go . After dropping my camera on the ground several times ( and putting a couple of nice little dings on its exterior in the process ) , I decided I 'd better get a case for it before my cool Sony camera ended up getting completely destroyed . This " semi-soft " case is constructed of a synthetic material similar to what you might see in the stiffer areas of a pair of basketball shoes . It " gives " a little when you press on it , but not much . The silver finish on it is an exact match for the finish on the Cyber-Shot , so you won't be disappointed with that .. this case and the Cyber-Shot were made for each other .. literally . My camera is the DSC-P73 , but check the specs on the case to make sure you 're getting the right one for your particular Cyber-Shot model . Sony makes this type of case in a couple of different sizes for its various pocket camera models . The case opens with a tug on the loop lanyard that is attached at both ends to nylon zippers running down each side of the case . When you pull down the zippers , the case opens like a clamshell , with the sides being kept from opening too far by two nylon cloth strips stitched to the inside material , which is that black nylon fleece that is commonly used in cases like this . Whether you have the case attached to your belt , or dangling from its shoulder strap , the case hangs with the hinge end downward , so gravity does the work in sliding the camera down into the case , and the clamshell construction helps to ensure the camera doesn't slip off to one side or the other while you 're putting it into the case . You drop the camera into the case , end-first , close the " clamshell , " pull up on the lanyard , and VOILA .. the camera is snugly-held and well-protected . There 's a loop on the back of the case for carrying on your belt , and the case also comes with an adjustable nylon shoulder strap , if you prefer to carry your camera that way . The shoulder strap attaches to the " top " end of the case with two swiveling spring clips , attached in turn to two nylon cord loops that are securely riveted to the back side of the case shell . The case also comes with a little pouch for carrying an extra pair of batteries and maybe an extra Memory Stick . This pouch has a velcro fastener on the back for attachment to the shoulder strap . In sum , you 'll be hard-pressed to find a reason to dislike this case .. it is truly a perfect fit for the Cyber Shot . I was just a little ticked off that Sony 's MSRP for it is $ 59.95 . The case is made in China , probably at no greater total expense than a few dollars per unit , so I can't quite figure out why I 'm being overcharged at least $ 25 for this important accessory , for no apparent reason other than the padding of Sony 's bottom line . I searched high and low for the best possible price on this item , and found it at B & H ; Photo in NY - just under $ 40.00 , including shipping . Not bad , but in my opinion , still more than I should have had to pay .
  I purchased this mount along with a Sanus wall-mounted shelf unit . This is installed into the studs , and is extremely secure ; it 's holding a 42 " Samsung plasma TV . It took about 2 hours to install the mount , the shelf unit , and for re-wiring my devices to the TV . It probably would 've been faster with help . With the tilting feature , it was easy enough to wire all of my devices on my TV while it was hanging . As each TV is different , however , I would recommend reviewing the placement of your TV and where your wires run to ensure you would not have any issues . I would recommend this product to anyone looking to mount their entertainment center on the wall and get it off the floor . It definitely opens up my living room and creates more space by getting it off the ground . I 've already received compliments !
  i bought these for my x-landlady to use with the charger i bought for her . She still uses these batteries today . They save her allot of money and that is a good thing she only has SSI to survive on .
  My rating : 1 star out of 5 = I Hate ItI wish I knew all of this before purchasing this product . I 've been using it for over three months and get more disappointed and annoyed each time I use it . Will this product satisfy your needs ? Read on and see . My complaints : 1 . The lights get very hot . The directions say to use them for only 20 minutes then shut them off and let them cool down before using again . This does not fit with my projects in which I 'm taking a series of photos for an hour or two in one session . I didn't realize this time limitation at first ( since I hadn't seen the printed warning ) and the lights began to emit smoke and a smell ! 2 . The lights are top heavy . They tip over very easily . The weight of their power cord is enough to tip them over . You have to be very careful to lay the power cords out in a certain way so they don't fall over . For example when the power cord is going down to a wall outlet , the weight of the cord pulls and causes the light to tip over . The weight of the cords also caused the lights to slowly slide across the table all by themselves as I worked . I even had a hard time keeping them pointed in the direction I wanted due to the slippery feet sliding from the cord weight . If the legs were heavier or had a tackier bottom surface , this would not happen ! Numerous times when the lights fell and I instinctively grabbed for them I was burned by accidentally touching the hot parts . 3 . The two lights that came with my kit emit different light . One is a blue cast and the other is whiter . One is brighter than the other . This is not good when trying to have even light from both sides ! 4 . There is not enough light thrown with these two lights . No matter how I position the lights , the entire box area is not lit well . 5 . There is not enough light to equally cover a box about 6x6 inches in size . Shadowing appeared to the sides of the item . Perhaps it would be fine for photographing jewelry or something less solid . 6 . When using the ` roof ' top , it blocks good light in the room from overhead lights . I didn't have enough light to take the photos . I had to use the camera 's flash to get enough light . I was hoping that the light box 's lights would give enough diffused light to evenly light the objects so I could photograph without the flash ; I could not . 7 . The mini-tripod that comes with the kit cannot accommodate a DSLR camera with a short lens . I had to use a separate full size tripod ( purchased separately ) , or shoot with camera in hand , which was not the best for taking perfectly leveled shots . Note the photo the manufacturer uses shows a lightweight point and shoot digital camera ! 8 . This kit , unlike other kits on the market sold at about the same price , does not allow for freestanding photography , such as lighting a dining room table to shoot food on a plate at the table setting . You have to use the box . Think about what kinds of photos you want to take and see which fits the majority of your needs . I 'd prefer a more flexible product , such as portable diffusers to put in front of portable lights which could be used to light something in its original setting or against a colored background . 9 . This comes with one background cloth : blue . I 'd have preferred white , which at least would have reflected light better . If you want other colors you will have to purchase those separately . 10 . The lights need to cool down before using the handy side pockets to store them in , so breaking this down is not as fast as setting it up . 11 . The outside pockets for storage of the lights are NOT padded and thus not much protection is given . Better protection would require keeping the cardboard box and storing the folded up kit in it . My praise : 1 . This is fast and easy to set up with its Velcro closures . 2 . The carrying case is convenient . - Perhaps a discounted price for this item would justify its shortcomings but buyer beware . If the product doesn't do what you need to do and you have to buy a second product , then the money you spent ( albeit discounted ) will have been wasted !
  Very nice fan , good build quality , which is standard in this brand . It 's not loud and it doesn't blow as much air but it 's good enough to cool down a device or in my case to use it to cool down a small place when there 's no electricity and the only option is the USB port of my laptop .
  I bought the EarJams largely because of frustration keeping the stock Apple earplugs in my ears . They kept falling out . The EarJams have helped alot on that score . Individual ears vary a lot so there 's no guarantee these will do it for you , but these fit me pretty well , if not perfectly . They also dramatically inprove the amount of bass that reaches your eardrum . I 've never heard a high-end earplug but I 'm happy enough with the sound I get from the Apple earplugs with the EarJams on them .
  i have been having this for about a year , constant use everyday , and its never given me a single problem . my main computer , wireless roughter , and xbox360 are all connected to this and are pretty much used everyday . produces little to no heat at all . its perfect for small lan partied or home networking
  Just a note that I was sent this item twice , and in both cases received a 9200 instead of a 9800 . IMHO , it should be modified or removed ..
  I love this GPS unit , I used it every day and it ( almost ) always got me exactly where I wanted to go . But a serious warning to all you owners and potential owners out there , DO NOT leave the unit or even the mount for the unit on your dash or windshield . My car was broken into and intentionally targeted because I left the suction cup mount on the windshield . They broke a window , and tore the car apart until they found the GPS unit locked in the glove box . If they know it 's there , they 'll break into your car , and take what they want . Great unit , but keep it hidden unless you 're using it !
  I HAVE THIS PHILIPS MODEL PCRW804K17 AND I HAVE TRY TO INSTALL IT BUT WOULDN ` T WORK . I HAVE INSTALLED IT BUT WOULD NOT READ THE CD . I DON ` T KNOW IF THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE INSTALL WITH A DRIVER OR NOT HOW DO I MAKE IT WORK ? DO I NEED A DRIVERHELP
  I hesitated to order when I saw the many negative reviews - returning is a bit of a hassle , but it can be done , and this player looked like the best choice for me . I 've had it for six months now , and it has never given me a problem . The sound is beautiful , much better than the 15-year old five-disk Sony carrousel it replaced .
  I have read most of the reviews concerning the excellentBehringer UCA222 U-Control Ultra-Low Latency 2 In / 2 Out USB Audio Interface with Digital Output And Downloadable Software Bundleand the equally excellentBehringer UCA202 Audio Interfaceand I have seen several questions asked repeatedly . While I cannot truly add anything to the fine reviews already written , as an owner of both models , I may be able to answer definitively certain of these common questions . 1 ) Will it work with my computer ? Yes it will if your computer has USB 2.0 or 3.0 ports . While I believe it will also work with older computers which have only USB 1.1 ports , I have not tried it with such so I cannot comment about that older port ( which has not been offered for about ten years now ) . The USB port supplies all necessary power to these devices ; no external power is necessary ( nor can external power be applied ) . 2 ) Will it work with my operating system ? Yes it will . My older ' 202 ( purchased several years ago ) states it is compatible with Windows XP and Mac . My newer ' 222 ( which I just purchased last week ) states it is compatible with Windows XP , Windows 7 , and Mac . In actual fact , as it requires no external drivers of any kind , it is compatible with ALL operating systems ; I use a GNU / Linux OS ( Xubuntu ) on my computer and both work perfectly with it . 3 ) Does it come with software ? Well , Behringer 's instructions state that a free CD is included . It is not . But you can download some software from Behringer 's site ; this software may or may not work with your computer but this really does not matter . Suitable free software is readily available all over the web . If you use a GNU / Linux OS , you need only enter " Digital Audio " into the search box of the Ubuntu Software Center or , preferably , into the Synaptic Package Manager 's search box . There you 'll find plenty of software which works with Linux ( more software than anybody would ever need ! ) . 4 ) Can you monitor sound as it is being recorded ? Yes , using headphones , you can , choosing to listen either directly from the USB output or from the RCA inputs ; there is a small switch which makes the adjustment between the two . 5 ) Is there a digital output ? Yes there is , an optical one . If your equipment has only a coaxial digital input , optical-to-coaxial converters are readily available at low cost ( Amazon sells several ) . Note that the optical output transmits only two-channel sound ; there is no provision for Dolby or DTS multi-channel . 6 ) Is there any difference between the two units , the UCA222 and the UCA202 ? Yes there is . The UCA222 is red in color with a red LED . The UCA202 is silver in color with a green LED . You buy either of these units based on a ) price at the time you order one , and b ) color preference ( if any ) . THAT 'S IT ! Color is the ONLY difference between these units . The circuitry is identical and so is the operation and performance . Please note that these are strictly 16-bit [ up to ] 48 kHz units . They WILL play back 24-bit 192 kHz files but they will convert them down to 16-bit 48 kHz . Will you hear a difference ? That depends upon a ) the equipment you 're using and b ) the sensitivity of your hearing . Remember that , if you 're playing CDs or files made from CDs , they are 16-bit 44.1 kHz only so that 's all you 'll hear regardless of the DAC you use . I use these devices for travel . They are lightweight and robustly built . $ 30.00 ( approximately ) is a true bargain for something of this quality . The sound produced is superior to the sound supplied from your computer 's headphone output and that improvement can be heard by anybody . I hope that I have touched on some salient points . If anyone has any questions , please feel free to ask them in the Comments section . I highly recommend these Behringer Digital-to-Analog USB devices . Thank you for reading this . Lawrence H. Bulk
  Buyer beware ! While it may work fine at first , it will break in no time ! I purchased this laptop less than a year ago , and although I was extremely careful and gentle with it , it is completely useless right now . The screen keeps fading , and only extreme and constant pressure on the screen at a certain angle will bring back the content . However , it 's not possible to type and work on it while putting pressure at the same time . So I 'm left with no laptop in the middle of a college course :( I tried contacting the seller over a week ago , and haven't received a response at all . This is by far my worst purchase ever !
  This viewsonic T.V. is great as long as you know how to hook it up . Unlike regular T.V. 's if you hook up to this T.V. using the Coax Cable the picture will be awful . Now if you hook up using the S-Video , Componet , or Composite Video the picture will be perfect . That 's why Plasma 's are considered monitors instead of T.V. 's What the cable and satilite companies don't tell you is that you 50 % of signal strength when you use the coax cable hook-up , or what others call the RF adapter . Regular T.V. 's can make up for this signal loss plasma 's can't . So for all you out there do some research before you buy a Plasma .
  I bought this antenna to improve upon the 3 channels I was getting with a cheap RCA antenna . Now , I 'm getting 4 channels but not the two channels I was getting before . Very frustrating . Not worth the $ .
  I purchased this item and am blown away by its effectiveness . I started this device up and immediately detected not one , not two , but five seperate UFOs in my immediate area . I am currently working on a way to communicate with what I assume is an intelligent species visiting our planet , but so far , I have been unsuccessful . I am waiting to see if this company will be selling a UFO communications device in the near future . If it is anything like this detector , I will be extremely happy . Thank you for a great product !
  I went to my local camera store and rented one of these . I must say , the pictures were of a so-so quality , but other than that , this camera really sucks . The auto features are rather lacking in quality , but then again , I really dislike using auto , so it may just be me . Then , I compared the general feel of it to my old Ricoh KR-5 , and this camera feels , well , junky . It is overly heavy , and not because of sturdy construction . Canon , Minolta and Ricoh are constructed sturdily , not this one . This has what I would describe as a flimsy feel , and when used in manual mode , well , the camera does not feel up to par when compared to every other brand , model , and make out there .
  Not too much to say about this microSD card . Excellent value , reliable brand . Works as it 's supposed to , no problem with the adapter or computer ( Mac OS X ) recognition . I use it with my BlackBerry Curve - automatic recognition .
  I graduated in Business Adm and I really need this calculator in my financial business . I do have the HP platinum and now I bought this one for my secretary .
  Update Oct 2010 : Now that I 've used this unit for over a year , I am totally disgusted with it , and maybe DVD recorders in general . I say that because I own two units of two different brands , and I am inclined to conclude the whole format is sluggish and unreliable . My old VCR works better , faster , and more reliably . This unit will appear to record a TV program until I stop the recording , at which time it presents an error message stating that recording on this disk is not possible - this is with a disk that has worked before , and that has plenty of space left . You 'd think it could tell me when I first put in the disk , but no - it waits until the program is over . This happens every other time . I 've been using the same brand and type of disks all along , and the problem has only just begun recently . Another problem : It looses the time just about every day , so I can't preprogram it to record . The only thing this piece of junk does reliably is play rental movies . I would like to try a hard disk video recorder , and I hope that technology is better .
  The Sangean WR2 radio was a lot heavier than I thought it would be . well made , sounds great . It tells you what song is playing and the artist , so if I like the song , I can write the info down and purchase it . It also has a nifty alarm clock I recommend it highly . - Mario
  this actually added flares that don't appear without a filter .. i am extremely dissatisfied with this purchase , and have just ordered a Hoya UV filter within a day of receiving this .. don't cheap out on a filter , this is a product in which the money is necessary to ensure quality , i 've learned that
  Excellent for a Canon T3 . Has a place to hold spare batteries and the connecting cord to the computer . Nice and light . Excellent choice , and I 'm very glad I purchased it . In fact , after purchasing one for myself , I bought another one as a gift .
  Where will Rio go from here ? I suppose they could add an AM tuner and then throw in the digital remote control and car kit ? I started with the Rio 90 , which is actually a great entry product . But the SP250 with its built-in battery recharger , tuner , firmware , and more make it the item to have . I must say that the website we are currently on has a LOT of nerve charging more for this product than even the manufacturer is charging . " We sell items to you for more than list price-lucky you ! " That 's a load .
  While this seemed like a good idea it flunked as being helpful to keep anything warm as it barely heated the plate . I used it several times with no success in slowing the heat from coffee . If anything it sped the cooling . The product found a new home in my garbage can . I wish I had read previous reviews and I would not have ordered it . Total flop .
  couldn't stand it anymore , so have upgraded to the almost latest and greatest . i 'm not sure why some of the other reviews are having difficulty transferring files to their iPods , and the other complaints . for me the interface is very intuitive , loading in files is straightforward with iTunes , and the fidelity is more than good enough for me 99 % of the time . i don't use the supplied earbuds but use inexpensive but excellent sounding koss titanium headphones that can be bought on sale for $ 20 . for the relatively small incremental price increase i went with the 60gb over the 30 . just like Mac or PC hard drives , just when you think you have a hard drive that is so big that " i 'll never fill this thing up .. " it is full . the only bad thing about all the iPod models is that they do get scratched up pretty easily . i solve that problem with an inexpensive silicone skin bought from eforcity website . no additional bulk , etc and the silicone makes the iPod easier to hold onto .
  I know many on here love this trackball , so please don't flame me . I bought this today and set it up . I was shocked at the flimsy , cheapy feel of the scroll ring , and of the motion of the trackball itself . I was not at all impressed , for 100 bucks . I 'm returning it .
  I find these headphones very comfortable . I use them on my computer for gaming and they do an excellent job . The best thing about them is the long cord ( esp . for use on a computer ) and very little leaking of sound that could bother your spouse ( my wife hates to hear my computer games ) . The sound quality i would rate as good , not excellent . These aren't audiophyle quality here - what do you expect for <$ 30 . They do a pretty good job for music . They do a great job with games . In fact , if your a serious gamer you owe it to yourself to get decent headphones , especially if you play first person shooters ( i hear planes / footsteps and know the direction they are coming from ) . Get these for your computer ! If your looking for some for your stereo , spend around at least $ 100 .
  This item does not work . It lights up but will not charge nor connect to laptop . Get what paid for , nothing .
  impressed with the quality of the camera , pictures look great . just as impressed with the quick service and delivery from Amazon . i was amazed when my delivery arrived several days before expected delivery date . i have been leary of ordering online but with this experience i will definetly do business with Amazon again .
  I would buy this product for as many laptops as I have . It is really great . Saves neck strain for sure , plus it looks cool !
  I bought this as an extension to a Apple 23 " Cinema Display . The female end does not accept the standard tightening screws , which may explain why the screen image had hundreds of pixels replaced by bright green dots , especially in darker areas of the screen . Either the connection cannot be made tight enough ( lack of screws ) or the cable is simply inferior . To check , I purchased a replacement ( same female to male 6 ' dvi cable ) by " Cable to Go " and it works perfectly . The replacement cable has tightening screws at the female end , so I don't know exactly why this StarTech cable failed , but it failed . In a quasi-controlled experiment , the StarTech cable gets one star ( you do get most of the video signal ) .
  I received my lens on Monday . I immediately tried it out and loved it ! I didn't have enough positive things to say about this little lens , but today , which is Thursday , I tried it out again . I had been using it about 30 minutes and the auto focus just broke . It simply just quit working . Manual focus was intact , but auto was gone . I was so disappointed ! I am mailing it back for a refund . I knew it was cheaply made from reading the reviews , but I really thought I would get at least a year or so out of it before it broke ! If you have the extra cash , go ahead and spend it on the 1.4 .
  I got this for my ibook . It works great and haven't had a problem . No AC needed for Mac with Firewire . Fast and easy to use . I won't recomend for USB1 user . It would be slow .
  Purchased for Nikon D80 and 18-200 lens . It does indeed fit , but it 's VERY snug . Some difficulty getting camera out of case in a hurry , but the case itself seems well made and well padded . Wish it had a bit more room for filters .
  I installed this pci card in my old Toshiba 1905-S301 - worked 100 % perfect . Download the driver from the Toshiba website . Its a 802.11 " b " protocol not a " g " , so you can only get a maximum of 11Mbs ( not 54Mbs ) transmission rate . I was OK with that .
  The rod broke the first time I used it . Says it handles a 15 lb . capacity and unfortunatley that wasn't true . Just started the return process and hope that the replacement works better than the first one .
  I have several Pelican products and I can't say anything bad about them . There priced well and built well . If you want something protected this is the case to h
  I gave this to my 14 year old in August , the hard drive went bad in October , we got it back from the repair shop December 5th , and the hard drive went bad again December 14th . $ 200 and he has been able to use it only weeks . The Sony Customer Support is useless , because they act like they have never even seen this model and have no clue how to troubleshoot it . I have spent hours on the phone with them to get no help . The repair service hours a terrible , so I have to call them from work to arrange any repair . My Ipod is going strong after 3 + years . Go Apple !
  I am posting this to affirm that Amazon is shipping the non-U3 version of this drive ( as I just learned when it arrived ) . The product number shown above is the number of the product shipped , and a look at Memorex 's website will indicate that this number is not the U3 drive . I called Amazon about this and spoke with Customer Support , who told me that all they know is what is shown on this page , so I could return the product if it is not as described . I am writing just to alert others : the product Amazon ships is not the product described in the editorial comments above - which might explain why their price is good . It 's probably a fine USB drive and probably a good price , but it isn't what you think you 're getting .
  I am a retired Electronics Technician with over 28 years working with radio frequency cable . Belden is a very reputable name in the cable manufacturing industry so I bought these . When they arrived I hand twisted the F connector to the back of the TV and the cable fell off with the connector still in place . I tried the other cable and the same thing happened . There is a short ferrule that allows the connector to twist on and it is a serious design flaw . You could treat it like a surgeon performing delicate brain surgery with just two fingers and it still will fall apart . I ended up going out and getting some different cable , F connectors , and building my own cable . Normally pre-manufactured cables are reliable but I guess there is a first time for everthing . Don't buy these cables , I wish someone else had left a review so that I would not have wasted my money and time . I 'm surprised Belden would tarnish such a reputable name by not even allowing some piece junk like this to get by them and be sold with their name . Maybe the first run of cables were OK and then they substituted for the cheap stuff without telling Belden . Mike K.
  I bought this to upgrade an old Gagteway 1.1GHz machine . It worked great with no problems .
  I bought the b-52 prodigy fx in june 2009 . i got it replaced becasue it was defective . I got a new one in august 2009 . it went defective a week ago . I have contacted b-52 to no avail they were not available even though i bought a exended warranty from guitar center where i purchased it . The thing is if you sell a product and it goes defective and no one is available for repairs or to even give you guidance on how to fix it , then there is a problem . the customer service at b-52 is horrible . The receptionist is a true B ! @ ch ! I would recommend that anyone that purchases anything from them make sure you are at least in the area where they are located in CA otherwise you are screwed as far as geting anything from them no less getting them to replace or fix their defective equipment . I am going to contact the BB in California and complain because for what i paid I think they should atleast have somebody available to service their customers . Good luck if you purchase this . It works great if you get one that is not defective . retailers beware their products dont last .
  This is a nice cool pad and works very well . It takes the heat out of the laptop and also serves as a buffer between the laptop and the lap . My amd laptop works better since it runs cooler with this chillpad . The only complaint I have is the power socket is weak . Rough handling will pull the power socket out and render the device useless . So be careful if you have toddlers or pets .
  I bought this mouse last year , and had to come back to post a review , since it has been such a joy to use ! I bought it to use on my Win7 Tablet , and pairing with the slate 's built in bluetooth was painless . Initially I had a huge lag from when I moved the mouse to when the cursor actually moved . It turned out to be a driver issue with my cheapo bluetooth adapter . Using windows ' built in microsoft BT stack solved this issue , which is great , since I can now use my mouse without the need to occupy one of the scarce usb ports in my tablet . If paired using the included bluetooth dongle , range is far better ( even better than my Logitech wireless laser mouse / keyboard combo ) , and there is also a special mode ( keep holding the button on the dongle ) to allow the computer to recognize the receiver as a standard USB mouse , so that you don't even need to install bluetooth drivers , in case you need to use it before loading windows , or with a device that doesn't use windows . Very clever . This bluetooth dongle also has a built in autorun feature which downloads Microsoft 's IntelliPoint software , to allow specific functions to be assigned to each of the mouse 's buttons . This software does not allow the option to enable an OSD to show things like Volume level , back , zoom enabled , etc , as logitech 's software does . The included usb dongle also functions as a standard bluetooth radio , without the need for extra drivers or a stack allowing you to connect to your cellphone , keyboard or any other bluetooth device . The mouse looks spectacular , even when inside its retail packaging , which allows you to rotate the mouse to reveal the underside buttons . It comes with a hard shell case to store the mouse and receiver when travelling . It is designed to be a presenter mouse , so I wouldn't recommend it as your main mouse for all-day work , as it is too small to be ergonomic , and it makes you hold the mouse in an awkward position to use the side scrolling or side buttons , if you have big hands . So far , after about three months of normal use , I am still on the original included set of AA batteries , which I find remarkable , as a 2.4Ghz transmitter and laser pointer should have a relatively high power draw . It has a very useful physical switch to shut all features off , but I only use it when travelling , as it also has a logical auto off feature , to save power . I have used it over a wide range of surfaces without the need for a mousepad , and the laser sensor has been fairly accurate ( not as good as logitech 's , but very impressive ) , it even works on an acrylic tabletop , where no red-optics mouse works . I would definitely recommend this product , as it is great , and you can find it at Amazon for much much less than the MSRP ; even at a lower price than buying a separate wireless laser mouse and a laser pointer and a brand-name usb bluetooth stick .
  I stumbled across this laptop bag in 2004 at a garage sale . It was brand new , hadn't really been used at all . About 4 months later I changed jobs and began to do a lot of traveling . This bag has been so amazing and durable . My wife calls it my man purse because I take it everywhere . And though it is heavy , I 'm willing to pay the price for all I 'm able to fit into it . My laptop and power supply goes into the middle spot . I used to use the tie down straps but I don't find it necessary as my laptop is large enough that is doesn't move around inside . I keep 1 3/4 " 3-ring binder in the filing area , along with a few magazines . In the front pouch I have meds , toothbrush , comb , my Myfi wireless hotspot , a small point and shoot camera , plus headphones and charging cables and more . In the front flip section I have my passport , my checkbooks , pens , a calculator , business cards and more . Amazingly , after all this time , the strap has never broken . The leather has held up really well and the zippers have never been an issue . They always work - ALWAYS . This is important on an item like this . Just recently the wire frame has started to come through at the corners as this bag ages . It is to be expected . But once this got really bad I expected the bag to just fall apart . It hasn't . Now , nothing 's perfect , so here 's what could be better : It could be a touch wider . You see , it 's great to take a 15.6 " laptop and figure out that you need a 16 " bag to fit it in , but then there is the trouble of the power supply . My Dell XPS has a large , flat and wide power supply . I can may it fit in the same pouch with the laptop itself , but it is pretty tight . Making the bag just an inch or two wider would be great . Making it lighter would be great on the wishlist of improvements , but I would not ask for that if it sacrificed the durability of the bag , which for me has survived 8 great years worry free . Thanks Targus !
  I used it with a Seagate Barracuda 7200.7 , 120Gb , configured as master . It recognized the HD correctly , assigned a letter , but as soon as I would transfer data to it disconnects . I tried with an usb HUB , and behing the computer directly , no difference , same problem . I ended up buying the Vantec IDE to USB adapter , it works perfectly on the same configuration .
  I tried setting up the router , but was unsuccessful . The web interface didn't work with IE7 , and web pages were being displayed garbled . I had to download Firefox to talk to it . The 1 gigabit output switch worked properly , as did DHCP . I set up the router for my cable modem , with static IP address and DNS servers . I couldn't connect to the Internet , even though the router thought I was connected . After a frustrating interaction with Linksys customer support , it was decided that the router was defective and I returned it . I also found from customer support that this model is not being supported under Vista .
  This is exactly what I needed and am very pleased with it 's performance . Easy to mount and easy to operate .
  At the price and promotion of these phones , much is left to be desired . Output is weak and limited . Modrate range only can be achieved via and EQ or Amplifier . Best suited for home audio , not for portables . Construction is light , weak and flimsy . Actually , the poorest build I 've seen at this price . The dynamic range of this unit is easily matched by most Koss units . A watch-sign is how Bose doesn't disclose this unit 's Ohmage , range or diaphragm set-up , in package or at the official site . Will use them while they hold together , not much choice . Not at all recommended . The noise cancelling model is great for flights but , still the same problems . A real disappointment , especially from Bose .
  I just purchased this switch for use with a desktop and laptop in my office . The shielding on the cables or the internal components is completely inadequate and the two signals obviously interfere with each other . Unless I set the refresh rate from the video out of the laptop to 60Hz and the desktop to 75Hz I get waves of distortion tracking horizontally accross the screen ( I have no idea what is magic about these rates ) . My advice : get a product with much better shielding than this one or plan to spend a lot of time fooling with refresh rates to hopefully squelch the groovy distortions from the video cross talk .
  I 'm sorry to say that this product failed to meet my expectations . ProsTight connection to laptopCons-Too easy to accidentally change the combination which makes it difficult to set the combo and remove the lock . - This product is built to fit on the right side of a laptop . If you 're laptop is like mine where the plug is on the left side , you have to turn the laptop around in order to unlock it ( unless you don't mind doing it backwards )
  I tried several other keyboards to match up with my Nokia N800 internet tablet but had bluetooth pairing problems . Nokia would not help with pairing non-Nokia products so I ordered the SU-8W keyboard . Unfortunately the layout of the keyboard was difficult to use . Further , the keyboard can't remain rigid when opened and must lay on a flat surface . This is unlike all the other keyboards I tried . Due to pairing problems with the other keyboards , I remain keyboard-less .
  This product had so much static i could not even listen to the music . Was very disappointed in it . will never buy again .
  I bought an m130 a few months ago and find it to be very handy . I can slip my SD memory card into the side and view pictures I took with my digital camera . The color is great too . The only con is that the stylus doesn't always work around the very edges of the screen .
  I had heard good words about this radio , but just didn't believe that a quality radio could cost so little .. Note that this is a large , bulky radio that takes " D " sized batteries . But - the fidelity on both music and voice is excellent ( large speaker and treble / bass controls ) . Very good FM sensitivity - I don't have to raise the telescoping antenna to listen to the nearest public radio station , 50 miles away . Battery life has been excellent . The radio has screw terminals for external AM and FM antennas , so this could be a good radio to use at work with an external remote antenna taped to an outside window ( and it has a headphone jack ) . My only complaint was that the dial pointer was quite a bit off on the radio I received . That was quickly fixed by disassembling the case and moving the pointer on the dial string . If you get one of these radios , have that problem , and can't fix it yourself , find a friend who can or send it back for another . If you insist on a digital dial ( battery eater ) , then look elsewhere . Otherwise , I doubt that you 'll find a better portable radio at any price .
  They HAVE NOT resolved the issues with this lock . It is pathetically poor . I am grateful for not having put it on the laptop before finding out that it is junk .
  I have nothing but good things to say about the BJC-80 . I 've had it for two years , use it almost daily ( mostly for color graphics printing ) and it 's still going strong . It travels well and is very convenient to use . Black and white print quality is excellent and color print quality is out of this world . I have the battery pack and use infrared with my Thinkpad notebook ( something about wireless printing that can really impress a client ! ) . I also use the scanning adapter - works fine on the road , but I prefer a flatbed scanner for most jobs .
  I bought these headphones as a lower cost alternative to the Bose . The only reason I give them four stars instead of five is because the Bose would be the obvious five . I think you would be hard pressed to find another noise cancelling headphone in this price range that would compare . I fly frequently and was amazed at this item 's noise cancelling ability . I find myself handing them to others to try just to see the look on their face when they flip the switch activating the noise cancelling feature . Overall a great product at a fantastic price .
  I 've been very happy with the HP printers I 've owned during the past 15 years , both LaserJet and DeskJet models . Until now . Printer # 1 showed gray streaks and magenta spots on the page in addition to blurry non-black text . HP sent me a set of new toner cartridges ; this fixed the streaking and spotting but didn't help the cartridge alignment problem ( what HP calls CPR or Color Plane Registration ) . Printers # 2 and # 3 were badly misaligned . Look at the right-angle lines on the configuration page . Non-primary toner colors are created by laying down dot patterns in varying densities to create say green ( yellow plus cyan toner ) . If they are not aligned correctly , the green line is bordered on one side by yellow and the other by cyan , resulting in blurry text and images . Look at these lines with a magnifying glass or do a 600dpi scan ( the printer 's printing resolution ) of these lines to see what I mean . I sent numerous scan samples to HP tech support and there was never a question that the printer was defective . Printer # 4 , at long last , was aligned properly . Unfortunately the page had gray streaks , broken text , and dark images had white spots ( where there was no toner ) . < Sigh . > HP offered to send me a 5th printer . But I 've given up . Four in a row DOA printers over the course of two months , to me means this is a poorly designed , fragile product . HP is sending me a refund check . And if you read through the HP support forums you 'll discover that I 'm far from alone . I think the entire 26xx color LaserJet family has some fundamental design problems . It is truly sad .
  I just blew $ 5 . The speakers are weak and distorted and when connected , my blackberry keeps glitching and prompting the voice dialing prompt . Not risking blowing up my phone with this toy . In the words of Dr. Phil .. " What was I thinking ? "
  I would have to ask my children after they have a chance to use it , sorry . Can't give any more info at this time
  The sound is great as many have said . On airplanes , they cancel engine and wind noise well . For me to give 3 stars to a product , EVERYTHING has to at least function . It 's cool that the cable is swappable and lead me to buy them . The sales slick says it takes 3.5mm jack . What it didn't say is that it takes a non-standard very thin jack so you can't just hook up to anything . In fact , you can't hook up to most things because most jacks are too fat ! These are full size cans ! There 's plenty of room for a normal jack slot ! What were they thinking giving a skinny jack slot ? Yes , there are work-arounds and connector jockeying but I shouldn't have to compensate for poor engineering . If they wouldn't have done something that stupid , they 'd get a 5 . If you only use the included cord , consider this a 5 star review . If you plug into other cables , my 2 stars stands .
  Took me several ruined DVDs to figure out what the manual should have said but did not : when recording VHS to DVD , make sure the unit is in VHS mode and leave it there . Otherwise you will get a short bit of what you wanted , and then it will start recording off the back panel inputs . Problem for me was no indication it was recording when in the VHS mode . Could see the tape counter going , but the red REC indicator was not lit . Switch over to DVD , and the REC lights up , figured that was the correct thing to do , but you just screwed up your recording . You don't know it until the time is up either . Leave it on VHS and all is well , but the manual says nothing on which way to set it . The remote works fine if you are right in front . What confuses is some buttons become non-functional depending on what mode the box is in or what you are doing . No indication what the problem is , just dead buttons you think should work . More learning .. Errors in the manual abound , like it saying you cannot watch the VHS playback while recording to DVD using component cables . You can . Hints would have been great , such as when using the " Copylist " setting up a copy from VHS , stop the tape and do a fast rewind back to the start time . Otherwise the unit will start playing the tape and very slowly start reverse play back to the start . I am sure I will find more mistakes and unmentioned required steps . The DVD-VR357 works perfectly so far with DVR + R discs copying VHS , and from a cable box . Some commercial VHS tapes pop up as uncopyable , some copy fine . Have not explored how much ( HBO , Showtime , PPV etc . ) is copyable from the cable box yet . Be ready to learn for yourself and consider the manual as a source of sketchy and erroneous data . This is NOT a VCR , far more complex in operation . Too bad there is not a " users group " forum for it , that would help get people going . I think a lot of the negative stuff in the reviews is from difficulty understanding how to run the thing , not bad units . Update : so far have successfully recorded on DVD-R , + R , and DL + R
  I have had this lens for just over a year . I love everything about this lens except for the fact that I 've had to send it in for repairs three times . The auto focus motor ( SDM ) just simply doesn't work . I don't use this lens all that much . I shot 6 weddings last year with it and about the same number of engagements . The auto focus motor just refuses to stay fixed . It didn't work correctly right out of the box . It 's been replaced twice and now it 's on it 's way back for a third replacement . Unfortunately , this one is going to cost me money because I 'm a couple months outside of my warranty period . I really wish I weren't having this bad experience with this lens because I love everything else about it . The sad thing is that I 'm not alone in this . This lens has an unusually high auto focus motor failure rate compared to all of the other Pentax lenses over the decades . I 'm sad to give it only 2 stars .
  This product was a great value ; however , it did not perform well for our church . We had a big problem with feedback .
  What can I say , Great deal for a whole lot ta backups . fast delivery . Had only 1 disc that wouldn't work but who could complain for the price we paid . Under $ 20 . can't go wrong there . Just think of all that hard work you needed to have a backup of that you spent hours ( or days perfecting it ) on just to see it disappear without a trace , because you didn't have a disc to back up your work . Better get some now while you still can .
  I have had a 380n Sony UX PC for the past year , and love it ( after removing all the crapware and reverting to XP ) . I bought the far cheaper Sony external DVD burner with the USB2 connection for maybe $ 90 and it works great . No need for this unit and its Firewire connection unless you really want Firewire .
  I was a little hesitant on ordering this 7 port hub after reading some of the other reviews . However , I received the product , followed the instructions for setting it up and it works like a champ . I 'm using 6 out of the 7 ports and have not experienced any problems at all .
  Got them at the sale price . At this price I have absolutely no complaints . Here my comments based on my comparison with my other buds . 1 ) Noise reducing . Yes they are . I 'm typing as I listening to them and they do cut down on the clicks compared with my other ones . 2 ) Ear size , there are 3 sizes of pads , small , medium and large . Both the small and medium fit my ears but I 've noticed that the medium pads really increases the bass . It really makes a difference compared to the small pads and my other buds . I haven't compared the bass with the big pads but I won't since they are too big to fit comfortable in my ears and I won't be wearing them . 3 ) Sound quality , The deep bass with the medium pads , I 'm not too worried about that because I can use the equalizer on my MP3 to adjust that . 4 ) Yeah , they come in a cheap Ziploc bag but as long as the price is good I 'm fine with that ! Overall very pleased with them .
  I saved 170 bucks buying this camcorder from here . And it is all they claimed it to me . It came in factory sealed box . Don't pass up this deal .
  This router has a very nice feature set but very unreliable . First the wireless AP stops working if no wireless connection for an extended period . Also 128 bit encryption is not reliable . Have to reboot the router to get it work again . Second the whole traffic stops for no obvious reason randomly . Cant even get the configure page . again have to reboot the router . hit that twice and I am extremely annoyed since I host my own mail server . called the customer service . the guy was polite but knew even less than I do about technical issues . I hope they will release firmware upgrade soon to fix those issues . currently I switch to a netgear FM114P but will wait for a while before I sell the SMC on some local list .
  Ok I have read all the info on this Lens several times and found nothing to state it is a " white Box " lens . No warrenty !
  I bought this thinking it was a " real " super audio cd player , boy was I wrong ! The ONLY difference between this player 's reading of the Sacd and Cd layer is that the Sacd area allows more information than the cd layer , otherwise this player gives you no real difference in sound between the two . It took me a long time to realize I was fooling myself into thinking that I was really enjoying Sam Cooke 's " Portrait Of A Legend " SACD the way it was supposed to be heard . I have been doing a lot of research and found out a player has to have 24bit / 192khz DAC capability to even begin to enjoy the SACD layer and this player does not use that method to produce playback of SACD . ( If you 're on a budget make sure you look for that in the techinal analysis ) Once again this is NOT for anyone who wants to hear the true beauty of SACD . I am now about to purchase the Marantz SA8260 SACD player . It has gotten great reviews and was rated " class A recommended " in Stereophile magazine .
  I can't believe I paid $ 40 for these damn earbuds . Worst purchase I have ever made . Since the beginning the earbuds easily fall off your ear and diminish the sound quality when it does . You really have to push them inside your ear and the comfort is unbearable . The original headphones are much better and take it from me I know because I have tried alot of headphones out there and these by far have got to be the worst . I was really dissapointed when one of the earbuds suddenly died without any explanation . What makes me really mad is that I really don't use them that often . AGGHH ! If you are into sound quality try out the Bose Quiet Comfort Headsets . The sound is amazing and no other headphones come close to it . The name speaks for itself when it comes to comfort . I 'll leave you with a last note .. IF YOU WANT TO SAVE SOME MONEY , DON'T BUY THESE HEADPHONES !
  I have purchased 4 Olevia TV 's ( from 27 " to 42 " ) and until recently I would have recommended them to anyone . First there was slow rebates , but I was aware of that problem when I made the purchase . Then it came time for service , and my experience was the same as recent reviews . They are very nice and promise to take care of everything .. DON'T BET THE FARM . Just like others have said here , they say parts will be shipped ( in my case on the 3rd ) then a week or two later you 'll find out that parts haven't shipped , or on back order . BIG HINT : If the manufacture of a product has major components on back order , your 's is not the only one broke . I 've bought 4 , but Olevia has got the last dollar from me and if you 're smart they wouldn't get your first one . I think some retailers like Office Depot and HSN have dropped the line and just selling off stock . DO NOT BUY ! You have been warned .
  I set out to purchase the best ballhead for my needs and I instantly assumed that I had to spend upwards of a hundred dollars . After doing some reading online , I realized that I was wrong . This ballhead is a perfect fit to my Velbon El Carmagne tripod . It came with the additional threaded screw for whatever tripod you own . It even came with a tool for securing the screw in place , properly . I have a Nikon D40 and 18-135 lens and it is extremely sturdy in my tripod . It should be able to handle any mid size DSLR and any Consumer Lens or wide angle lens that you happen to have on your camera . The only thing that I wish it had was a built in level but for the money , it was well worth it . I can always purchase a level for my hotshoe but I doubt that I will even use it .. Enjoy !
  I bought this on February of 2006 . It stop working on May of 2006 . For $ 180.00 its not worth it . Everytime I put in the DVD or the VCR this machine would turn off by itself ! At first , the DVD will not work if the video is not in the other side , so we have to put the video in , then switch it to DVD so we can watch the DVD . Now it just simply does not work altogether . For this problem DO NOT BUY its not worth the money .
  I don't use filters much at all , but this circular polarizer works fairly well in removing unwanted reflections . You get what you pay for . This is not a bad filter , but hardly the best one out there .
  ok so i bought these and the first pair sucked so i had to contact the seller and they were so understanding that they sent me another pair , BTW thank you . These are really great hedphones though despite the first pair i got . they are nice and loud like i like . i think people should buy these because you really cant find these like you use to ; i cant find these where i live . its like there extinct now :) I love these
  There 's no in between with this thing , I either get nothing ( and my laptop tells me different ) , or all 5 , though this is rare . I don't expect anything different , but it will pick up secured networks just as well as unsecured . What 's with the little flashlight ? It 's about as useful as a wet sock and hard to work . This is the first Wifi finder I 've had , but there 's got to be better products out there .
  The claims are that the colors in the prints will last twenty years . Unless you adhere very carefully to their suggestions they barely last twenty days . So you must go elsewhere to print any photos you want to keep without excessive worry .
  I own a Honda CR-V . This product falls off of the dashboard every time I accelerate . Sometimes it just tips over and hangs by the wire . Not so goof .
  I have been using the Roadmate 700 for several days . It is modeled after the " NeverLost " navigation offered by Hertz , which I used last June on a trip down US 1 . The 700 is very intuitive , easy to program and simple to use . The internal hard drive contains virtually all of the addresses and points of interest in the USA ( they indicate that over 2 million are entered ) , and all of the maps are seamless . I easily programmed a trip from Western NY to Tampa . The guidance voices are very natural sounding and allow you to listen to either a male or female . I didn't find them obnoxious , and my passengers were impressed with all of the advance warnings , such as " left turn , followed by a right turn in 0.5 miles . " The touch screen works well . The on-screen keyboard is easy to use and large enough to accomodate my fingers without making typing errors . The on-screen address book allows easy logging of familiar places . The screen is not exceptionally large ( 2.25 by 3 inches ) . But the resolution and clarity are great and the view features allow clear , bright visualization of ( 1 ) the map or ( 2 ) a sequential list of all the upcoming streets / highways to be navigated or ( 3 ) what is called " Trueview " , which is a large yellow arrow overlying a blowup view if the next intersection , showing the direction of the turn onto the next street or highway . It 's easy to see your next turn with a quick glance . The mounting bracket allows reasonable placement of the Roadmate by hooking it into an airvent in the middle of the dashboard . It is secure enough to stay put but is still a little floppy and I had to stabilize it with one hand in order to use the typing pad ( regardless , for safety reasons you should be stopped anytime you attempt to use the touchscreen ) . I 'm already looking at the optional mounting brackets , which are just becoming available . There is an instructive cd enclosed and a built-in tutorial . I did a lot of researching before spending the big bucks for this unit . I installed it in a new vehicle ( rather than ordering a built-in navigation system ) and I intend to take the Roadmate with me to use when I travel by air and rent a car . It plugs into any lighter and requires no tweeking . If you are looking for the best of the portable GPS auto navigation systems currently available .. this is the one to get .
  While I haven't used any other tripods , I am fully satisfied with this one ! I bought this tripod specifically to use with my new DSC-R1 camera . It was listed as the preferred tripod in the camera 's accessories book , and seemed to have a lot of nice features , so I figured I would give it a shot . The tripod is extremely light weight , and is ideal for taking on hikes or walks . It comes with a little bag to carry it in , which conveniently fits over your shoulder and hangs behind your back . It has a quick-mount for the camera ( i.e. a little piece that you screw onto the bottom of your camera that can easily be put on and taken off of the tripod , so you only have to spend about 2 seconds mounting the camera onto the tripod at any given time . To assemble the tripod out of its container from fully compact size to fully assembled size takes all of 10 seconds . You unhook each of the leg pieces and let them slide to full length . You then tighten those leg pieces and pull the legs out until they click into place . Despite its light weight , it is quite sturdy . It 's also very customizable as to height or camera orientation ( you can just about get any shot or angle that you want ) . It tilts on all axis and can get as low as 7 inches off of the ground . All in all , this is a great tripod . Again , I haven't tried any others , but this tripod has yet to disappoint .
  I got the dock late and when it came it worked for about a week . Then one day it stopped and one of my friends had to stick something behind the ipod and the piece that holds that ipod up in order for it to play .
  " Piece of junk " is too kind ! We have easily spent more on ink cartridges than we did on the printer . We have yet to print one ream ( 500 pages ) but we have replaced the black ink cartridges about 10 times , and they cost [ $ ] each . Maybe wedon't print often enough and the ink dries out , but I 'm avoid printing to save on ink .
  works great . sounds great . once I understood how to use the software . everything went smooth transfering the songs to mp3 format .
  These RCA wireless connectors are okay for basic phone conversation over short distances . Don't bother trying to use them for data such as with TiVo or a computer . They simply won't work . They use a fairly old technology and even basic phone conversation can result in interference from other devices in the house .
  This product turns poor quality and service into an art form . Buggy and difficult to install software , which after hours of work by expert techs renders only poor quality video . The only thing worse than the quality of the product is the quality of the service . If this is the future of the industry , be afraid . . . be very afraid . Doug
  I bought a TuneBase for my iPod about a month ago for a three-week , 4,000 mile road-trip . I just got back and am generally pleased with the way the TuneBase performed . It worked well , it was easy to operate , and it held up well to being tossed in the glove-compartment or under the front seat when I wanted to use the outlet for other things . Pros : The TuneBase was extremely easy to set up and tune . The tuning was a one-handed operation ( let me stress that I did it only when stopped or when my wife was driving - tuning this thing while at the wheel and careening down a mountain road would be as smart as reading or applying make-up under the same conditions ; given that there are idiots who do those things ( I 've seen them , and thus learned that the universe isn't just - if it were , it would promptly remove them from the gene pool and take out no one else in the process ) , the ease of operation enhances your odds of survival should you wish to change frequencies and drive at the same time ) . The flexible neck made it very easy to turn the iPod so that the screen was easily readable wherever I was sitting . The unit looked reasonably nice , it fit well in the glove compartment , and when my daughter whacked my son across the head with it , it made a satisfyingly solid " thunk " that didn't damage the TuneBase at all . Cons : Like any FM transmitter , the TuneBase is subject to interference from radio stations , CB radios , and power lines . I gave up trying to listen to my music in large cities and during thunder storms . On those afore-mentioned mountain roads , centrifugal force set the iPod swinging off to the side like a tree in a hurricane ; the effect was accentuated by the long goose-neck which gives the force a long lever arm through which to act . There was a frequent annoying whine during the soft passages of classical music , but there were no problems at all with pop / rock music , which tends to have a more limited dynamic range than classical . Overall , the TuneBase worked very well across the mountains , prairies , and west-Texas desolation . It wasn't very useful in large cities ( even when I found unused bands , there was a lot of radio noise ) . It worked beautifully when I wanted to listen to Latin , pop , or similar music . It was okay for listening to most classical music , useless for music with extended soft passages . ( But on an extended vacation with two small children , who needs music with extended soft passages ? What 's really needed is a way to drown out their screams - I 'll be looking into iPod headphones soon . ) I 'm going to get an iPod dock hardwired into my car as soon as I can , but the TuneBase has been a perfectly adequate stop-gap solution to my travel needs . If you prefer rock to Bartok or drive mostly in rural areas , it should be more than adequate to your needs - it will be outstanding .
  Got this radio for Christmas . I was intially impressed with its reception both am and pretty good for shortwave . However , this is not a radio that you would want use long term . I used it daily for 3 months when my other portable radio ( 10 years old ) died . It was the evident the radio was cheaply made . The volume knob came loose over a month ago-you have to shove it back on . The radio fell over from my dresser about 3 feet on to carpet and the station finder stuck in a slanted position . Additionally , there maybe some problems with the eletronics the volume seems to have a mind of its own it goes up and down randomly . Also if you use batteries in it the flashlight feature can easily come on during transport .. so there go your batteries . That said : it worked for the first couple of months and maybe it can serve as a back up radio , but it would be cheaper to have good 20 $ radio with some batteries handy .
  I thought this was the best thing since sliced bread to keep me from straining my voice during my Pure Romance parties . I speak for about an hour in groups from 4-35 people and when there is an air conditioner and 2 fans running in the same room , I usually end up with a sore throat from straining above the noise . I purchased this amplifier and received it in just a few days . Tried it out at a party and it was wonderful . I used it at a 2-3 more parties and was thrilled ! I always stored it in my laptop case put away in its own bag securly . The next time I went to use it , I could get no sound out of it . Brought it home and gave it a full charge . Tried it again and still nothing . Realised that the main unit had shorted out and I could only get sound when I held the cord to the headphones in a certain position against the unit . I promptly returned it .
  I received this great trekker pack yesterday and I 'm very happy with it . One very neat feature is that you can adjust the height of the hip hugging flaps to suite your torso height . I fiddled with that a couple of times until I got the flaps to high hip level , where , when buckled together , transfer the majority of the bag 's weight onto the hips , releiving the shoulders and neck , a great feature . The looks are also very cool and stylish , but I think there is a bit too many ribbons and bucles flying around . Granted , they allow you to fine tune the bag to suite your body to a great extent . The interior is large and is actually more than I need for my EOS 20D , 3 lenses , and a camcorder . One of my selection criteria was that I wanted a bag with extra space to hold other stuff , not just cameras . This bag meets that criteria very well and it has another smaller bag that can be attached to it . Overall , I think I 've made a good choice and I 'm happy about it , although it does seem a bit too heavy that I kept checking to see if it contained some temporary shipping stuffing that was making it such . This extra weight is why I give it 4 rather than 5 stars .
  Could not be worse . I hate it . I use it flip 6 months . Also I use it only because at office of another is not available . That it has earned every times is necessary to climb under a desk , to take out all 2 USB a connector and to insert them back . It kills my second computer . When it happens the manager is compelled will not only replace it but also to buy a new computer . If you like to climb often under a desk - buy not reflecting !
  The keyboard works as expected with this unit . The mouse does not . When the computer is rebooted , the mouse does not want to reconnect with the receiver at all . I have to power cycle the machine to do it . Mouse tracking is also very bad . There are times when I can take my hand of the mouse and the cursor on the screen will slowly move towards the top . Clicking is also intermittent .
  I got the camera because it looks cool . It turns heads every time i take a picture . It 's easy to use , and great for web-work . It 's smaller than i thought , about 2.4 " high . The battery lasts about 1hr , and with the 8meg stick you can take more than 60 pics at 640x480 . You can take 5,10 , or 15second mpeg movies with it , if you 're using it for the internet , you don't need much more than that . ( till the real broadband gets here ) The picture does get distorted in the dark , but it has several features to fix that if you take time to read the manual . It would be nice if it came with a carry case , and had a steady shot option . Overall it 's a cool camera .
  its not wireless , its not even that expensive . But see if you can find it in your local computer store and type on it for a few minutes . You 'll see right away why its been rated so highly by everyone . I still miss my old IBM model M ( everyone 's favorite keyboard ) though it has long since been obsolete ( no USB , too loud , too heavy , by today 's standards , tho it had the best key-feel and feedback of any keyboard ever made ) . I havent been happy with any of the new keyboards since 1986 ! ;) Until now , that is . I initially went shopping for a Logitech Dinovo ( or the S510 , which is similar ) . After trying them out I decided against , since they were too similar to my toshiba laptop keyboard and I was looking for something less cramped . I came across this one at the store and liked it right away . For me it has the right balance of key-stroke depth and key-spacing . I feel it has just about all the ' positive feedback ' and ' feel ' as the old IBM M model . Now , you may ask : this keyboard is whisper-quiet and ' soft ' , while the M model was loud and clackety-clack-hard . How can they be compared ? They can be compared in terms of the ' confidence ' with which one can type on them , the equivalent typing speeds and error-free typing that both can produce . In my case , I type as well - fast and error free - on this keyboard as I ever did on the model M.It inspires typing-confidence . The keys feel substantive under your fingers , meaning you are always sure where you 're finger is going . The tactile feedback is quite positive , though it has been described as ' soft ' ; I think ' bouncy ' might be a better word . ( Like the old model M , remember ? ) I think what makes the tactile feedback so nice is that I not only immediately know when a key has ' registered ' after I press it , but I also immediately know when my finger has left that key . There 's a little ' push ' . So I almost never hit two keys at once , or hit a key out of sequence . My fingers fly across it - without the clackety clack , but with as much confidence . The rest of the stuff on the keyboard are luxuries , and nice ones - the zoom slider , the media and volume controls , and the ' favorites ' buttons etc which I have mapped to my favorite applications . I 'm sure I will use them . I especially like the ' calculator ' shortcut key over the number pad . Its like having a built in calculator since it pops up immediately . The setup for personalizing the keys is very easy and intuitive . You should update the software to the latest version ( in my case the CD was version 5.2 but there was a 5.5 update at microsoft . com / hardware . If you do a lot of work in front of the computer , you cant get a better keyboard than this in terms of substantive luxury and feel for a fraction of the price of most other keyboards . Other keyboards may be wireless , or sleeker looking , but dont get fooled . For just over 20 bucks you can get a keyboard that will truly make your job easier , connect reliably , and make your fingers fly with confidence . In sum : Typing comfort is a very subjective thing , but go try it out in a store if you can . Typing on this thing is like driving a go-kart : point and shoot . Feels like a Lexus , priced like a Honda .
  The player itself gets 4.5 stars , but the quality control / documentation gets 0 . The player itself seems to work fine once I got it working . The controls take some getting used to . The USB cord is ridiculously too short , especially since they recommend not using a hub . A belt clip would have been nice , too . There are apparently two versions of firmware for the player . Version 1 is the basic one that allows the player to work on Windows 98SE , 2000 , ME and XP . Version 2 is the PlaysForSure enabled version that allows ( allegedly ) full compatibility with many subscription services and Windows Media Player ( a big advantage over the ipod which currently does not support this ) . The catch is that Version 2 only works on XP at this time . The MP3 player I received was shipped with version 2 firmware . Luckily I use XP , but those without it are stuck with a player that doesn't work . You can downgrade to version 1 , but you need an XP system to do it ! Additionally , the Zen Micro Media Explorer has two versions , one for Version 1 firmware and one for Version 2 firmware . My player was shipped with the software for version 1 firmware , consequently the software didn't recognize the version 2 firmware on my MP3 . I had to download the corrected software and finally I got everything working . On the plus side , Creative has a nice website with troubleshooting tips ( none that helped here ) , plenty of downloadable updated software , and a user forum that was invaluable to helping me get things figured out . Creative needs to communicate clearly what firmware to use with which software and operating system . Their biggest blunder was shipping a player that can only be used on XP despite the box saying it could be used on 98SE , ME , 2000 , XP . This is unacceptable and I 'll think long and hard about buying their products again .
  This fits my Nikon D3000 perfectly with the kit lens . I don't have a zoom lens yet , so I 'm not sure if it will squeeze in there or not . This is great for throwing my camera in my purse and not having to drag around my separate case . It secures the camera , but is still easy to get it out to take a quick shot . Highly recommend !
  This is an original Canon brand cb-2LV battery charger that came with a Canon camera . We purchased it as an extra to have at a remote location , preventing loss and inconvenience .
  Ok , my intial take on this was nice looking , dual alarms , great deal . I was wrong ! Don't be misled , this may have dual alarms but one is for the radio and the second alarm is a buzzer . Why would Timex possibly create an alarm clock where both alarms couldn't be radio alarms ? I hate waking up to that annoying buzzer sound but now between my wife and I , one of us has to . Second , the viewing angle is poor , it 's hard to see the minute digit if the clock is facing slightly away from you . The screen is recessed into the clock so the side of the screen blocks your view of the time . Third , the date is so large on the screen it is almost confusing because it 's right up agains the time . I know that 's being picky , but figured I 'd mention it .
  We have just gotten this printer , but it 's going back ASAP . An extremely knowledgeable computer expert suggested we purchase this printer and installed it for us . The first thing I noticed was that the print was too light . It turns out that this printer is not really Mac compatible , despite the manufacturer falsely advertising it as such . There are a number of features only available for PCs . Here is the fiine print of page 33 of their own Brother Laser Printer User 's Guide : You can change the following printer settings when you print from your computer . _ Paper Size _ Multiple Page _ Orientation _ Copies _ Media Type _ Paper Source _ Resolution _ Toner Save Mode _ Duplex printing ( Manual Duplex printing 1 , 3 / Duplex printing with Duplex tray 4 ) _ Watermark 1 , 3_ Job Spooling 1 , 3_ Quick Print Setup 1 , 3_ Sleep Time _ Status Monitor 1_ Macro 1 , 3_ Administrator 1 , 2 , 3_ Insert Command / File 1 , 2 , 3_ Page Protection 1 , 3_ Print Date & Time 1 , 3_ Density adjustment 1 , 3_ Error Message Printout 1 , 31 These settings are not available with the BR-script printer driver for Windows . 2 These settings are not available with Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 / XP . 3 These settings are not available with Brother Laser driver and BR-Script printer driver for Macintosh . 4 This setting is not available for HL-5240 . Note the large number of features not available for the Mac . You can fiddle around with print features in Acrobat , Word , etc .. , but obviously this is neither convenient nor satisfactory . Already I can see I 'm never going to be happy with the print density . The most basic function of a printer is to print pages that are easily readable . This printer is always going to come up short in that department . I fully believe the other negative comments I 've read about this printer . I 'm not waiting around to see them come to fruition . I 'm so disgusted with the lack of proper Mac compatibility this time-wasting contraption is going back to the dealer forthwith . This is one of those cases where you get what you pay for . The time involved messing around trying to set this thing up properly completely oblitereated the initial attractiveness of its price . Having said all this , we kept the printer after all . I must say it is fast . The print density was finally adjusted so it is deep enough , but there is no easy way to change it . So far we have no way to stop a job if we change our mind after hitting the print button . While this printer is fast it is still very far from ideal for a Mac user .
  I recently bought the Adaptec videoh media center and right from the start I had problems . When trying to install the drivers I would get an error saying that this hard-ware cannot be installed . I called the tech support . They sent me an email on how to install the drivers which didn't work , so I called tech support again . They had never heard of this problem , but told me that the problem was with my computer . So I reformatted my hard-drive . When I tried installed the drivers the computer would freeze up and my mouse would not work . I called tech support one last time . Their response was something is wrong with my computer and they could not help me . I tried this on another pc and I ran into the same problems . I sent this back to Amazon with a note explaining all the problems I was having asking for a full refund . Don't buy this product ! I am a computer tech at a university and this was the first time I had any problems like this or ever heard someone say sorry we can't help you . If I could I would give this product no stars , but I can't
  I bought this to replace my mighty mouse on my Imac whose scroll wheel had died . Great mouse but the software from the disk would not load on mac . I was able to download the drivers form the kensington website . Otherwise no glitches .
  After having mine for just over a year , it quit working . Palm offered to repair it for $ 150 and told me that they only last for 3-5 years . Less if it is used more . As you may guess I am very disappointed . It is a nice tool but by the time you buy 3 of these you could by a laptop . Too much money for a disposable item .
  works well , easy to install , lots of little extras added . i use this for skype and conferncing with my German headquarters . works great . definitely a good product for cost .
  Please note that if you are buying this camera to use with your Windows XP machine the hardware has NOT been " Windows Logo approved . " That means XP does not accept the updated or old driver software . And , you cannot use this camera ( 3.0 ) with your XP computer .
  I bought this device to hook up a Logitech wireless mouse via a Linksys KVM switch to 2 PCs . The mouse motion was erratic and tended to overshoot the target screen item . Installed latest mouse drivers , no effect . Tried hooking mouse directly to PCs , works fine . Tried hooking KVM switch directly to PCs , also works fine . Problem is clearly with the USB / PS2 converter . Called technical support at IOGEAR who admitted that they have problems with some cordless mice - they recommended I return the device . At least they were honest , but it would have been better if their product worked properly .
  I recently upgraded from basic speakers to a 5:1 speaker set and discovered a hardware problem with my old sound card , a Creative Labs card that was a standard component with my system . The documentation that came with the card wasn't great , and it took a while to identify the problem , so I was looking outside the Creative family for my next sound card . I 'd read several good reviews of the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz card , so I figured I 'd take a shot on it . That shot definitely paid off . I have nothing but good things to say about my new sound card : installation was easy ( I only had to unhook the microphone connector from my old card and snap it onto this one ) , the drivers installed quickly and easily , and the accompanying software was far superior to the software that I had from Creative . There are a host of sound options available : your standard volume-by-source controls , a graphic equalizer that can be turned on and off with several presets , options for multiple speaker setups with an accompanying image showing where your speakers should be connected ( 2 speakers , 4 speakers , 5:1 , and so on ) , and additional applications if you want to get more involved . I haven't had a chance to put the card through its paces with a decent game , but the difference in listening to my iTunes files is amazing , and the control I have over the music is great . I 'd definitely recommend this card to anyone looking for a reasonably-priced , fairly high-powered sound card , and with Amazon 's newly-lowered price , it 's an even better deal than when I got it . Buy it and enjoy !
  Worked fine for 86 days . Then it died . While I don't expect these devices to last forever , 86 days seems a little bit too short . While the price is good , it probably is not really worth it .
  Bought this product when it was on sale , Wanted to get a radar scanner for quite some time and this one was pretty cheap . But , NOT worth the 40 $ , It goes off at random times , dose not go off when a cop is near , nor far away , drove passed a total of 7 cops in one morning . It sat there quite as a mouse , until I drove pass a bridge with no cars / cops on it and it lights up like the 4th of July . waste of money
  This does not fit in my 2006 Ford Focus . The wiring harnesses on this are completely different sizes from the one coming out of my Focus . It also comes with no instructions for this particular harness . Im pretty disappointed in Bazooka .
  How many pictures will it store ? It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about . Well , considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries . The Lexar Media 512MB Memory Stick Duo Pro , like most 512MB cards , will store on average 568 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera , 426 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera , 256 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera , 204 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera , and 160 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera . These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera . I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this 512MB card is the right capacity for your specific needs .
  @ AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COST ! @ The same exact thing that happened to one reviewer here , happened to me . I tossed this piece of crap out the window and it 's rotting in the California desert somewhere . You know those little metal balls that hold the CD in place inside the player .. It popped off ! GARBAGE design .. It 's not even real berring type balls . Best way to describe it is .. A flat washer that fits in place with 3 little tabs that look like those Metal Berring Balls .. The pressure from inserting / removing CD 's .. pushed that washer off and it 's loose . I tried to get creative , and took 2 really small / mini screwdrivers to pop the washer back into place .. but it just pops back off when you put a CD in . Im real careful with my stuff and this is pure barbage . SHAME ON KOSS . I will never buy any of their products again . There should be no rating star for this product and Amazon should remove this completely from their site .
  Sound quality very good . Noise canceling feature works quite well considering the size of the headphones . Major drawback is the separate power pack needed to power the noise canceling .
  This GE digital messaging system is one of the best that I have ever seen or tried . Add to that the fact that this machine won't cost you an arm and a leg . There are several reasons to like this GE messaging system . For starters , this machine is one of the first to offer 40 minutes of storage capabilities . Most of the digital machines out at the time of this review only allow 15 to 20 minutes . Secondly , there are 4 mailboxes on this machine , making this a great machine for a family or roommates to use . Even if you live by yourself , the separate mailboxes is perfect to use to store messages separately from the main mailbox . Another great feature is the clarity of the messages as they are being played and the time / date stamp . I have had absolutely no trouble understanding my messages or the digital voice in the machine . There is also a battery back-up you can use to help save your messages and settings in case there is a power failure . ( 9-volt battery is not included ) . The directions that came with the machine were very easy to read and understand . 10-minutes after taking the machine out of the box it was set up and ready to answer my calls . One of the best features , to me at least , is that it has a toll saver feature . When set to toll saver , the machine will answer on the 4th ring if there are no new messages and on the 2nd ring if there are new messages . When you call home to check your messages , if it rings more than twice you will know that you have no new messages and can hang up without having to waste your time . There are a few drawbacks to this GE digital messaging system , the main one being that the time / date stamp plays at the end of the message instead of the beginning . Personally , when listening to a message I like to know when they called in advance so that I can process the message accordingly in my mind . Aside from this , most of the drawbacks are small and do not affect the fuctionality of this machine . If you are in need of a new answering machine , or just want to change from tape to digital , give this great little machine a try .
  I had mine for less than a month when the antenna wire pulled away from the magnetic part of the antenna . -I have to qualify this by saying that I did not install the antenna per the instructions . Because I live in a bad neighborhood , I can't leave something like this on the car - it would get ripped off . So every night when I got home I would carefully remove the antenna and put in inside my trunk . After a few weeks of this , the wire broke off from the magnetic part of the antenna . The exact same thing happened to my wife 's unit . Maybe this would not have happened if we had installed the antenna " permanently " , but let this be a warning to anyone who thinks they will be able to take this type of antenna off / on . Now in our cars we are both using home antennas . We put them inside the rear window , which works very well .
  I have had this set for several weeks now , and have had very positive experience . Let me summarize my set-up : I receive analogue ( not digital ) cable signals , HD over the air , have an up-converting dvd player as well as an analogue DVD recorder and a VHS recorder , also analogue . I 've used the set connections for HDMI , S- Video , Component and cable ( RF ) . There are also DVI and digital audio connections which I haven't used . HD picture at 1080p , 1080i , and 720p is great , as it should be . Purchased movies ( I tested Star Wars ) look outstanding via the up-converting DVD player and HDMI . Analogue is less great , of course , but I was pleasantly surprised that non-digital cable was quite clear and not as grainy or " artifacty " as I feared it would be . This set would be more than adequate for anyone transitioning from an analogue set-up to a pure digital one-as we all must , apparently . It works great with analogue signals and , with 3 HDMI outputs , should be useful well into the digital future mandated by our overlords . . . For comparison , the picture seems as good as a similar sized plasma set , and , in my opinion , is superior to rear projection DLP 's that I have seen . On this set blacks are rendered dark black which I understand was a difficult feat for earlier LCD screens . Cons , such as they are : The connections are all on the left side of the set . If your input devices are on the right end of your media center , as are mine , buy longer cables because 6 ' ones will probably be too short . HDMI cables seem particularly prone to easing themselves loose , so you will want some slack in the connections . Amazon sells longer versions of all the types . The only other negative I can see is that this model has a reflective ( shiny ) screen . If you have a bright light source in front of the screen , such as a lamp or a window behind the viewers , I can see that reflections could be a problem . I have lamps well off to the sides of my set , and one positioned behind where the viewers are . That lamp does reflect somewhat and I tend to turn it off when watching movies when the other room lighting is lowered . Sound : Built-in speakers are OK for 90 % of TV watching . I have an antiquated amplifier / receiver that I use to drive a small center speaker and four bookshelf speakers for movies . The set has a digital output and one set of RCA sound outputs . If you already have or wanted a proper surround sound set-up , the LNT4065 should be up to the task given the right amplifier / speaker combination . As far as buying a TV over the web , believe me , I had my doubts . I have to say my experience was quite good . The set was delivered by Eagle Delivery and that was painless . They set up a delivery timeframe , the driver called and gave me 30 minutes notice before he showed up , and he unpacked and did the initial checks to see that the set was working . I would definitely buy another big-ticket item this way . I still giggle like an idiot every time I see the very same ( or lesser ! ) model of TV for hundreds more " on sale " locally .
  The time starts ticking when the item is purchased , not when it ships ! The GPS that I bought will not ship for another couple of months , and I agreed to purchase it a month ago . So with the one year manufacturer 's warranty ( or whatever ) , and the three months ( or more ? ) one is actually being delivered less than expected .
  After owning the HD2 for 6 months I sold it on eBay . This is a tweener device - trying to be both a video camera and a digital still camera . I thought I was getting the best of both , but really the HD2 isn't great at either . Video and photo quality was fair - despite the 7.1 MP resolution , the picture quality wasn't as good as I had been getting from the 2MP Canon SD200 that it replaced . Sure I had more pixels , but subjectively ( mostly - " these don't look as good as your old camera .. " from the family ) the colors didn't look as good and there was reasonably high noise . Also the " image stabilizer " used cropping so you lose field of view on the wide end ( making the 39mm equiv . more like a 50mm ) , making this hard to use indoors . But what ultimately got me to put it up for sale was the drop in the number of pictures I was taking . I just didn't like using it as much so I didn't carry it as often and when I did didn't take as many pictures . Part of that was the quality , but more the pistol grip style camera just didn't work for me - I much prefer the standard box shape . It wasn't all bad , it has a long 10x optical zoom in a small body and pretty high compression ( with good quality ) on the videos . After selling it I went back to a standard digital camera , I bought aCanon PowerShot SD870IS 8MP Digital Camera . I 'm much happier with this , it is a great digital camera that happens to take good SD videos , my picture ( and video ) count has gone back up .
  This product has been great . The digital tuner makes all the difference . Rather than ending up between a station you always get the right one . The radio is tiny and has very good reception . Battery life is also excellent . I think I 'm still on the original set of batteries !
  This has the potential to be useful but I found the trackball to be loose and therefore hard to get the control I want from a device like this . I found the left-click trigger , inside the lower ring , to be convenient but it added to the problem because if your thumb was on the ball , it sometimes shifted when clicking . On the positive side , it is inexpensive and , for someone looking for a device to use with a laptop when there is no desk space , it could be just what they need .
  Highly recommended for it 's size and ease of use . Sharp photos , high resolution and low price , make this one a winner ! Only problem is its reliance on Sony media .
  I bought this remote control but It did not worked out with my pioneer DVD player and my cable TV decoder although " the pretender " to promise so . If I were sony I 'd started to think a little better before to promise something to a customer .
  I guess I got what I paid for . The cable works , but it only produces a black and white image on my TV . Oh well , not much $ spent .
  I had an Epson InkJet but for a long time wanted a Laser . HP makes great stuff so I tried the 1100se and I think you would like it to . Its very quiet and prints fast . I print alot and sofar I havent found anything bad to say . It not any bigger then other printers and it smokes them in speed . Im not sure how many pages you get per cartridge but they say more then Ink printers . I say its a keeper . Oh yea the print quality is very good . I keep mine set to low so it dosent use alot of toner .
  I got these for my son the ones that came with ipod are so big they even hurt my ears they fit perfect and have size options
  i just got mine today and it didnt work . it played the first part of the first song only on each cd i put in it . it couldnt play any other tracks . i called the factory and they said it had a bad laser . so watch out for bunk players from koss .
  I bought this wall mount for my 54 ' Panasonic Plasma TV and had ( 2 ) of their " cheap " lag bolts snap in half ( w / one half in the wall stud ) during installation . If you make the mistake of buying this mount , I highly recommend you go to your local hardware store and buy quality lag bolts . In contrast , I bought the less expensive Cheetah brand mount and had zero problems . Do yourself a favor and buy the Cheetah mount .
  We bought this item after reading all the great reviews . We were so disappointed when we put it together . The screen is to small , besides that , there is so much static that we can hear what 's going on with the baby or see clearly from the static dancing screen . The monitor doesn't work at all with batteries in ( So much for handheld ) ; it only works when plugged in with adapters . Very disappointed over all . Send back and looking for something different in the store .
  .. and would suggest that you consider this one . The Carl Zeiss lens offers superb optical quality as compared to models without it . This has a great price and is easy to use . The LCD display is convenient and the traditional view finder is great for times when the glare is too much for the LCD . You can record movies with sound and play them back on the camera . You can also review instantly any image that you take so you 'll always know exactly what you have . With the addition of a memory card you can shoot an amazing amount of images . The camera offers multiple modes including auto exposure , shooting in low light with and without flash , with a soft background , portraits , landscape with a distant focus , waterside scene with rich blue , red-eye reduction flash , and macro capability to list a few . It is small and lightweight , fitting into a pocket easily for quick point-and-shoot moments . I own this camera in silver and bought the second black one for my son who also recommends it .
  the link does not go to the correct item . Please fix it then ask me again I did not order or purchased a Garmin Marine Swivel mounting bracket .
  We had bought a sigma 70-200 f / 2.8 and was not happy with it at all , so we bought this lense because the reviews were very positive , and we are very happy with the lense . It takes excellent pictures and the IS really helps . The quality of the optics is excellent . We had such a good experience with the lense my brother bought the same one and is equally happy with his purchase .
  Shame on you Sony , for even selling this inferior product ! I returned mine after one week !
  I thought I had it made when I bought a small pair of Altec Lansings , which I bought at Goodwill for $ 5 . After a few years , they started to " fizzle " , and I needed another sound alternative . After researching the field , I took a chance on the Creative Lab group , and it 's been an interesting learning experience . I am an audiophile , a DJ , and currently live in a small space . I needed speakers that were built very well , which would withstand constant use . My neighbors all are forced by the management to use earphones while listening to music or stereo , while my goal is to have very good sound without offending a soul . So far , I have been very fortunate to be able to continue to live in this manner to which I have grown accustomed . I have owned several pairs of Creative T20 's speakers over the last few years , and always kept the volume set below medium . Last year , when my computer developed a volume malfunction , it blew out every pair of T20 's I had . I then invested in the pricier Creative Gigaworks T40 's ( Series II ) , as well as a pair of M-Audio Studiophile AV-40 's , and I 'm very glad to report they are both holding their own very well in my musical world . Looking back , I would purchase the T20 's again only if I could be certain they would never stray above medium in volume . Not a very great recommendation for a pair of speakers , is it ? The T40 's are very good speakers , in my opinion , and yet , they are not quite equal to the rich , deep sound of the M-Audio Studiophile AV-40 's . I believe the M-Audio 's are the better value , if you have that extra bit of space . I do have some monster , heavy-duty speakers in storage , that I intend to someday fire up when I am living in more expansive surroundings . Until then , I am free to enjoy my music more fully , even in a more controlled environment .
  THE ABOVE REVIEWER HAD HARD DRIVE PROBLEMS . I DID TOO AFTER 6 MONTHSI CAN'T GET MINE REPLACED AFTER THE FLIMSY 90 DAY WARRANTY . THIS PLAYER WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME . GIMME AN IPOD .
  Amazon , when you decide to label something ' mac compatible ' , please check whether this is indeed the case . I spent $ 50 on this printer , only to find that it didn't work with my computer .
  Recently we have tried 3 different RCA products and had problems with all 3 . When you call RCA Customer service , you will end up talking to someone in India or the Phillipines who barely speaks English and doesn't really care about your problems . We bought one of these RCA MP3 players and contrary to what it says , they will not reliably play WMA and MP3 songs mixed together . We had been unable to get an answer from RCA as to why and whether there is a fix . We were lucky enough to be able to return the unit for a refund .
  This memory module is reasonably priced . Installation was very easy and you will feel the performance improvement in your Vaio . Recomended .
  Just a word of caution , I have just received my second replacement drive for the CDRW 48X16X48 drive I bought less than a year ago , and the second replacement drive is also defective ! The original drive worked well up until about 2.5 months ago so I contacted the IO Magic RMA department , got an RMA number and sent the drive to them . After a few weeks I got a replacement drive ( which was not branded as IO Magic and had a different faceplate from the one I sent in ) an lo-and-behold , it was also defective .. It could burn disks at 12X and lower , anything higher than that and the disk would be full of errors ( checked using Nero 's CD Quality check ) . I wasted four CD-Rs from different manufacturers finding this out . So I send them another email , telling them the replacement drive was bad as well . After about a week I got a reply that said ' sorry about that , here is a new RMA # and we 'll have UPS come pick up the drive within 2 business days ' . ' Well that 's nice ' , I thought . And it would have been if only they had picked up the drive , which they didn't . A week later after sending them an email ( generating no response ) about why they had not picked up the drive , I gave up and sent it to them on my own nickel . Now I have received the replacement drive for the replacement drive and I am almost 100 % sure they just sent me back the same drive again ! Accompanying this defective drive was one piece of defective media ! A paper sleeve with a CD-R that was severely scratched and which had been written on already ( though the disk was unreadable . They probably wrote it with the drive they sent me .. ) . I 'm telling you . Do not buy any products from these guys if you ever think you 're going to have to deal with their RMA department and support . And chances are you will . And you know the funny thing is I don't even need this drive . I have three other fully functioning CD-RW drives at home ( BusLink & 2 Sony ) . At this point I am more interested to find out whether they are actually going to honor their warranty . And it makes for a good conversation topic when talking to friends . It is amazing how big a difference good support makes . When it is there , it builds brand loyalty , when it is not , it makes you want to sit down and share it with the world so they will not have to go through the same pains . I would highly recommend not buying any prodcuct sold by IO Magic under any of their brand names ( I / O Magic , Hi-Val and Digital Research ) . There is a high chance you 'll be buying a piece of junk and if you ever need support , you will not get it because they don't believe in providing their customers with support .
  The price is tempting but it isn't even worth 17 bucks or whatever it is after the rebate . I spent three months constantly re-setting the firmware and monkeying with the settings , and finally the thing just gave out and stopped powering up entirely . A completely worthless product that you should avoid at all costs .
  I purchased this mouse to use with my IBM T22 Thinkpad . It 's works well , and it looks great . It is small , and at first it was uncomfortable to use for long periods . I have gotten used to it ; now the full-sized mouse that I use with by desktop feels huge . I have only given in 4 stars because the PS2 adapter does not fit snuggly . It often loosens , and I find myself regularly having to push it back in . If the mouse is not connected when I boot up , the scroll wheel does not work . The USB connection works well , but with only 1 USB port on my laptop , I would have preferred a better fitting PS2 connection . Otherwise , no problems .
  Horrible horrible horrible ! I get booted from it every few minutes and then I get " No response from wireless router or access point " And it takes me an hour to get back on , just to be on for 5 minutes , then I have to start all over again . I can get 2 bars or signal from it while my laptop is sitting right beside it , yet my neighbors router is shown at full signal so I know it isn't my computer . This is so bad , I 'd rather go back to dial up !
  The picture is fine , the remote works , and Windows software it supplies is reasonably easy to use ( I didn't test the FM radio functionality ) . The main flaw with the supplied software is the lack of audio / video synchronization - video plays out about a half second before the corresponding audio plays - which makes watching news or scenes with people talking on screen annoying .
  I posted something ealier about installation of this product , and yes I agree that the remotes are [ inexpensive ] . And it is harder than the " easy install one connection alarm . " ( Novices don't bother . ) But Get Real People ! A keyless entry remote alarm for only .. What can you really expect ? If you want a Professional system Shell out the .. ( I think the Clifford on my ex-wife 's car was that much , and this one works just as well . ) Also people have also complained about the support ? Here is my Experiance , about one two years ago ago my Siren started dying , ( Lower volume ) I called up ( They Answered on second Ring ) and they gave me an RMA ( Return merchandise Authorization . ) I forgot the address today , so I called them up . ( They answered on the second ring again . ) and thus I shipped them my bad siren . They sent me one back a new one pronto but Forgot they Free Remote for my Trouble , I sent them a letter with a copy of the statement of a free remote and they sent me one . So far it 's been working great and even my [ inexpensive ] remote still works ( I have two spare and have only replaced the battery on the one . ) So even if the remotes are cheapy they have been working so No complaints . ( Again no Begineers install this Alarm I posted ealier about how to install it . )
  I Have had the 5005 for only ONE month and it is NOT working . In fact I dont hink the unit EVER worked correctly ( and I have followed the instructions carefully ) . First , let me state , I bought this unit beccause it records in ALL WRITE media formats-that is , I can record to DVD-R , DVD + R , DVD - RW or + RW and it PLAYS all those formats and more . But be WARNED-even if the unit WAS working - it only accepts CERTAIN forms of Media ( blank discs ) and the LIST of media it WILL accept is VERY limited in the DVD-R format . ( it can use RICHOH , IMATION & gt ; It CANNOT use Memorex , or MAXELL or even TDK DVD-R ( it can use the TDK DVD + R ) so finding Blank discs is a bit of a problem . NOW on to the Machine FLAWS : For some reason the machine is recording SOUND OUT OF SYNCH to the VIDEO . I have tried everything to correct this , changing RCA cables , using different recording media , nothing works . Also-it is a problem with the TUNER ? HARDDRIVE itself , because when i just WATCH TV thru the Unit-the SOUND is slighty OFF to the VIDEO ( DELAYED ) . well thta makes it USELESS to record on . ALl my recordings would be OUT of SYNCH . But that isnt the ONLY problem . When PAUSING during a RECORDING BEWARE-it will probably cause your DISCS to FAIL when finalizing . I have found a FAIL rate of about 25 % when you PAUSE a recording . THAT IS BAD . It is also FICKLE about what BLANKS it will record on . It seems to like the EXPENSIVE TDK + R media ( fail rate of about 20 % , still NOT good ! ) but it really HATES cheap DVD blanks ( fail rate of about 50 % ! ) . SO-i called CUSTOMER SERVICE , they emailed me a lengthy FORM to fill out about getting the unit replaced or repaired . I have emailed it back to them and am awaiting instructions . I have spent well over $ 100.00 on BLANK media so far and HALF of it is wasted and ther other half has SOUND SYNCH problems . I may have only 20 GOOD discs recorded out of 100 . I do not know if thisa is JUST MY UNIT , or in general , m the machine is not up to par . Cna anyone reccomend a DECENT DVD recorder for under $ 400.00 ? email me . ALso the instruction maunal isnt the greatest . I figured out HOW to do things by TRIAL AND ERROR , it is NOT that difficult a machien to use once you get used to it . It also looks fairly nice . its not too heavy . No annoying " fan noise " like in the RCA 8000 . No annoying DVDRAM problems like Panasonic . And it accepts and records ( if you can FIND the right blanks ) in ANY format . I just wish my unit WORKED ! Jewelblues @ aol . com
  I purchased this online at Costco a few days ago for $ 5.44 with free shipping . Don't think that Amazon always has the best prices . Shop around . I don't know much about shredder oils , but Fellows is a good shredder brand and put its name on this . The oil has almost no smell , is sealed airtight in a sturdy bottle , and is made in the USA . It works fine for me .
  It 's impossible to travel these days without a bag full of electronics , from the cell phone charger , the laptop AC adapter to a Bluetooth plug-in and more . The problem is finding enough outlets in a hotel room to plug in everything . The Monster MP 4 outlet travel power strip is the solution . The cord is short ; the plug fits into one of the receptacles , allowing the power strip to fit neatly into your luggage or computer bag . 4 outlets will provide enough plug ins so you 'll never be without power .
  I bought my Bose noise-canceling headphones about three years ago . They rate four-and-one half-stars for noise-canceling . However , they 're now held together with library tape . The headphone quality : cheap plastic [ .. ] . Maybe Bose should give a free roll of duct tape , instead of a free CD player , with these ' phones . I 'd upgrade my review to five stars if I could . Bose gave my a pair of their new , seemingly more sturdy headphones for $ [ .. ] , in exchange for my old , falling-apart pair . I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES ! Noise of ANY kind really bothers me , so these were an essential purchase for me . Studies have shown ( really ! ) that overhead aircraft noise lowers students ' test results . Noise stresses out most everyone . So , less stress for $ [ .. ] . Yeah , a lot of money . But they 're the best out there . Just think how much you pay for health care . $ [ .. ] is like a like a quarter in the health care industry .
  Very useful . The only thingthat could be better isHow long it takes to gear up and locate satellites . It is a great training aid .
  This product ruined my iPhone battery . My iPhone battery actually lasts less than 2 hours since I started using this terrible product . I need to massage the plug into the iPhone . It doesn't even plug in easily . Yes it 's cheap but chances are it 'll ruin your iPhone like it did mine .
  I got this for Christmas , and it 's a mixed review for me . I 'm actually pleased with the sound , as I wanted this for my office at work . Just wanted something I could plug my nano in and so replace the boombox I had here . So for what is required of it , I have no problems with the sound , as I never really crank it up . However , the ' visual ' component was a major disappointment . Within a week the ' bulb ' at the top no longer functioned . I gather there is a short of some type , as if I push down on the glass ball on top I 'll get a visual light effect for 2 seconds . Otherwise , nothing . Since part of the appeal of this was to have the light effects WITH the speakers , I 'd have to advise caution in buying this . You can probably get speakers just as good cheaper elsewhere , and my experience says you are rolling the dice if you are buying this for the light effects as well .
  It is easy to use and to set up . It works and the readout is very helpful . I use it for my AV setup . Without the monitor ( TV ) on , I have over an hour of time to finish a TiVo recording if one is in progress . With the monitor on I have only 7 minutes ! My TV is a bit of a power hog , and this UPS device shows me just how much .
  I bought this to use with my Canon 55-250mm IS lens . I was interested in macro photography for fun , but not enough to blow 300-700 $ on a 1:1 macro lens . using the opteka I can manage to get 1:1 or larger , but with pretty heavy chromatic aberration . There is decent sharpness if you can work with the ultra thin DOF . Hand holding is out of question for the + 4 and + 10 macro filters . I was able to minimized CAs in Lightroom to some extent . This is ok if you just want to play with macro photography on a shoestring budget . If you can up your budget by about 200 $ , the Sigma 50mm 1:1 macro will probably be a much better buy .
  Horrible .. don't buy it . If you can find a place to position the unit so the radio picks it up you still will have poor quality audio . I put it in a drawer someplace and forgot about it .
  I haven't used this product yet but the cherry color is a wrong match for my Cherry colored Polk Rti series . I wish I had a heads up on this before buying .
  This is not the keyboard in the picture , however , i kept it because I was in dire need . These are hard to find in retail stores .
  Positive : It looks nice , feels nice , and protects the screen very well . Negative : Maybe this is just because it 's new , but I find it hard to get the Garmin out . Worse though , the close fit on the sides " diddles " with the slide switch and may turn the unit on .
  I 've mostly used this to play records , which is nice . I also bought a USB turntable , but I 've only been using that for digitizing records . Most times , I just want to listen to them in my living room . The cabinet matches nicely with my furniture , and my kids think it looks really cool . It would be nice if this had inputs / outputs to attach external speakers , or even output to a computer , but I can't fault it for that . It 's a beautiful piece of furniture that performs well as a record player / tape player . The CD player is a little bit funky . Maybe I 'm just getting used to it . It 's a three CD player , that seems to get kind of stuck . Again , I think I 'm just getting used to it . Haven't used the drawer yet , but I 'll think of something to do with it .
  For the money this is a great camera ! For someone with large hands it might be awkward to use . My husband felt it was " too flimsy " and the zoom button was too small . I had a S30 Canon which was a lot pricier and more sturdy for my husband 's large hands . After 11 months it broke . I got this A70 to replace it - I figured if it broke in 11 months I wouldn't have such a big $ investment in it ! After 8 months it 's going fine . Would highly recommend for a beginner or amateur photographer .
  I could not get this to work on any TV . There are no lights on the remote , so you can't tell if it is even sending out a signal .
  I bought this Palm when my old one died after 10 years of constant use . It took a little while to adjust and find all of the features I was used to , but since I did , it is doing exactly what I wanted it for . For a couple of days about a month after purchase , I had a lot of difficulty with this Palm-It was buzzing and went kind of whacky . But I did a hard reset and now it is back to normal . I endorse this product and recommend it for someone who wants a reliable PDA .
  They are light weight and fit nicely . I don't care for earbuds at all so these are the only way to go .
  I purchased this product two weeks ago and was very pleased with the ease of setup and operation . That is until today , when the timer missed it 's 7:00am wake up call and when I removed the battery cover , I found the compartment and I am assuming the electronic control board completely flooded . Bringing this garbage back where I bought it and hopefully I don't have to wait until next Summer before they get me another one .
  Bought this even though I knew GPS came with window mount because I don't like things obstructing the windshield . This item keeps GPS in place on dashboard of my SUV and is easily portable to rental cars or other vehicles .
  Worked perfectly with an iMac G4 right out of the box .
  It 's not full DVD size . It 's for a camcorder and won't work on my full-sized DVD player . I 'll get something more appropriate locally .
  The Micro Explorer is made for larger compact and Super Zoom size cameras . For travel , long weekends and events , the Micro Explorer is a perfect trip case for the Panasonic FZ28 . I load it up with two spare battery packs , the battery charger , two extra SD cards with a reader , lens pen with a cleaning cloth , a filter lens and the lens hood . There is still a little more room in the Micro Explorer case to add more accessories like the HD cable if needed . When carrying the camera but not using it , the strap closure is extra security that the camera and case contents will not fall out . A tip to open the strap closure latch easily : pinch it at its very bottom on both sides at the same time . The zipper pull located on each side of the case cover eliminates the problem of fumbling to open and close the case . The trick is to move both zipper pulls to the middle to close the case and to slide both zipper pulls in opposite directions to fully open the case . For everyday use , I carry the FZ28 in a Tamrac Aero 20 which holds just the camera and only essential accessories , but it is much lighter and less bulky than the Micro Explorer . It is a misnomer to call the Micro Explorer a DSLR camera bag and Tamrac does not advertise it for DSLR use . Amazon does a good job advertising products , but it still pays to research manufacturer 's websites to see if an item is right for one 's use . This is the Tamrac webpage for the Micro Explorer : $U$ Explorer 1 is a good bag for small DSLR cameras or for carrying an external flash and accessory lens for an advanced compact camera . The webpage for the Explorer 1 is : $U$
  Although I havn't had the same problems as the other reviewers , I 've had my own unique problems . And boy am I looking forward to the new problems ( my time 's almost up ) At first I thought my dvd player was possessed . Then I figured out it 's just a peice of junk ! My two main problems are : - after skipping , fastforwarding , or pausing , the subtitles come on . Not a huge problem , but a nusance none the less . -I 'm convinced my player hates me , and doesn't want me to enjoy any dvds . When I eject , it waits about a second and a half , and then it goes back in again . I have just enough time to drop the dvd in or get ahold of one before it shoots back in trying to take my finger ( and I suspect my whole body ) with it .
  Very good printing quality but cost a lot of less than the OEM part . Highly Recommended !
  It 's a pretty convinient bag . I put a Canon rebel XT with a Tamron 28-75 lens , a Canon 70-300 lens and a external flash inside and I still have the small pocket for wallet , keys etc . The only drawback of this bag is , you can not put in big lenses . The Canon 70-300 is the limit . But if you only have a limited gear collection , you need to give it a try .
  These are so great . I 've bought 4 sets for myself and gifts . My mom loves them because she can't hear well and she doesn't have to have the tv up so loud that the neighbors can hear . My grandson has ADHD and when he put them on to watch tv he paid attention because he could hear clearly . I use them when I 'm watching tv and trying to cook or do laundry and can still hear the tv . I can even go outside and still hear , they have a good range . I tried several kinds and these are the best !
  Before i purchased this software i was seriously excited , and thought ' Wow know i can carry on doing what i do , and continue and maybe extend my music making capabilities . ' The day i recieved this product i picked it up and installed it . Straight away My 500 odd ram pc was saving it to my drive , v .. e .. r .. y .. slowly , but i thought it was normal . Then when i turned the software on , the large picture came on , making me think this software was going to be fun , easy and very user friendly , but guess what ? IT WASN'T ! It has a very difficult setting and is very hard to use and even though i read the manual i still didn't know how to use that thing ! I would definetly suggest purchasing " magix music maker 5 delux " it is WEEYY better !
  I wanted a full size keyboard I could put in my ( large and heavy ) laptop bags . A keyboard with poor touch that requires that much preasure to type on isn't worth having . I filed it in drawer 13 . Live and learn . It is waterproof and flexible .
  Granted .. i bought a refurbished unit , and it worked wonderfully for a while , but it WILL develope the dredded ' lose data on battery change ' problem . Disappointing . Hot sync before you change , and then after to restore data . I really wish someone would come up with * THE * fix , as i can handle SMT componants , and this spoils an otherwise great little PDA .
  Love it . Use it as a spare set . Hold the charge for extended period of time .
  The arm band is too long for women , it didn't feet me ok and the orange canal is located in the wrong side
  Before getting the Belkin Y cable , I used a " premium " Radio Shack brand Y cable that cost over three times what the Belkin cost ( one of the features that made it premium was that it has gold-plated plugs ) . I wanted a second Y cable so I could have the same set up in two bedrooms , each of which has a stereo system in it . For purposes of this review , I tested the Belkin cable as follows : 1 . While the Radio Shack cable was connected to the Line 2 out jacks of an Onkyo TX-8222 stereo receiver , I connected the Belkin cable to the Line 1 out jacks . I then used each with a laptop playing a web radio station ( WQXR FM , which plays classical music ) , switching back and forth while listening for any audible difference in sound quality . ( I switched by connecting and disconnecting the mini-plug on each cable to the headphone jack on the laptop . ) My ears detected no difference . 2 . With the Belkin connected to the laptop and the Onkyo set to Line 1 , I turned off the streaming web radio and turned the volume on the receiver up to the maximum level ( the volume on the laptop was already at the maximum level ) . There was , as I 'd hoped , zero hum and " total silence " ( as in the scene in Fargo when Steve Buscemi 's character attempts to engage his crime partner in conversation ) . 3 . I then connected the Belkin to a Sony Walkman MP3 player . No problems whatsoever ; the sound was crystal clear . 4 . I twirled the mini-plug in the laptop headphones jack to which it was connected and listened for any electronic noise . There was none . I moved the laptop around ( e.g. , from the bed to my lap ) , and there was no noise . The cable came neatly wrapped in a Belkin cardboard and plastic display package , and the cable itself looks and feels rugged and durable and appears to be of excellent quality . Update , 8/7/12 : Since writing the above I purchased two more of these cables , one directly from Amazon - which was identical to the first one I bought - and one from an Amazon marketplace seller - which did not come in a Belkin package and which consisted of thinner cable than the authentic Belkin cables . I contacted Amazon about this and was able to return the imitation Belkin for a full refund . So if you order a new one from a secondary seller and it does not come in a sealed hard plastic and cardboard Belkin package , you probably got a cheap imitation . ( Neither the authentic Belkins and the imitation have any markings on the actual cable itself that would identify it as a Belkin , so one must go by packaging and in my case by being able to compare two that I know are authentic Belkins to one that is markedly different in terms of cable thickness . )
  Although the sound quality is not as crisp as you might get from a CD but definitely better than or at par with FM stereo .. mine is Toyota Camry ' 99 and there are no issues with orientation of the cassette adaptor ..
  I took a long .. time before I purchased this camera . Looked at all of the competition - even the SLR 's . Everytime I pick up this baby I am remimded of all of the reasons I selected it . BIG screen , great focus , loads of options . Having the 7.2mp allows me to give the camera to my wife and get a great shot . She doesn't always frame the picture well , but with this many pixels , you can blow it up , crop , crop , crop and end up with a great picture . One recomendation . when you get the camera - take a couple of days and learn all of the options for setting lighting , lens speed , etc . It can make a big difference in the quality of pictures . Yes , it has a best shot function , but the more you can help - by setting portrait vs landscape - indoor lighting vs daylight will only help the results . ONE complaint - this camera can only work with the docking station . There is no recharging cord . So when you travel - you take the docking station with you or get backup battery pack . This solution works depending upon how long the trip is . I hope Casio will reconsider their product engineering and next time consider the road warrior . Summary : It has consistently given me great pictures . Small form factor is great for carrying the camera all of the time . Great value for the money . Would buy it again . I have owned it 6 months - shot thousands of pictures . Buy a high speed SD card for video . It does that well too !
  This is a perfectly serviceable solution to our need for a power strip to accommodate a community worth of cell phone chargers , but the pivots are tight and the whole thing takes a bit of muscle to use . Other solutions out there seem like they might be a little easier and more seamless to use .
  As an UCLA Engineering Alumni , I was taught that digital signals either reach the destination or don't . There 's nothing in between and there 's no such thing as a " better signal " . However , after my fellow audiophile buddies kept pushing me to have " faith " in cables , I gave it a try . After spending almost $ 300 on this HDMI cord , I was transformed and nominated for the next Nobel Peace Award . The cable was too fast it beamed me to a parallel universe altogether . There , I used the sound of words flowing through these magical , Chinese-made copper to convince Ahmadinejad to give up its nuclear program and make peace with Israel . Middle East became the most peaceful place on Earth . Kim Jong Un was ready to democratize its state and welcomed the South in warm arms . Cuba declared itself the 51st states of United States of America . After listening to the music flowing through those cables , criminals burst into tears and became model citizens . As I dip those cables into water , it turned the water into dark energy and a cup of which was able to power the entire earth for a year with no pollution . The Inconvenient Truth turned into The Convenient Magic and I was personally thanked by former Vice President Al Gore . However , I don't recall any improvement in either the audio or visual experience with those cables .
  For the money , I am recommending these speakers to everyone I know . They sound great and get plenty loud . No , they won't knock your socks off with bass , but I am really impressed with the clarity of the sound .
  Definitely more comfortable than the regular ipod headphones but the sound blatantly sucks . There is about 0 % bass that can be heard . Waste of all money .
  For an entry level cable it seems well balanced , far better than typical red and white cables and will integrate with most components I 've tried . 5 stars for value but be warned connectors grip tightly , this will keep you from changing cables too often if you like to compare with other cables .
  The card does not meet the advertised 45MB / s write speed . I am only getting 23MB / s read and 20MB / s sequential write . Purchased with a CF to IDE adapter intending to use as a solid state drive in a laptop , however due to technical reasons this brand is not suitable as a boot drive unless you modify the Windows driver . Lexar tech support was not very helpful , stated they do not support use as a fixed drive in a computer . Pricey ! I guess it would be decent for use in a camera , but my tests show there are better / faster 300x cards out there for less money .
  I was really please with the service it got here the day before I needed to use this equipment . Thanks !
  I wish I saw all the negative reviews before I wasted money on this . I 've tolerated it for 4-5 months .. and just went back to my original Dlink G router that is working 1000 times better . The Belkin would constantly drop the wireless connection . 4-5 times an hour . I thought maybe something was causing this ( distance or interference ) . But finally the other day I thought to move the unit to the living room to get better reception and fix the problems . Crawled in the attic , ran ethernet cable , ran the cable modem too . Pain in the a * . Well , no better . 7 Feet away still dropped constantly ! The biggest problem was dropping wireless every other minute . Plus many sites just seemed slow to load , and others would not load at all , but switching the router these same sites loaded right up . Many of the reviews on Amazon have the exact same symptoms . Oh well . it 's been 5 months so can't return and getting new unit thru Belkin sounds horrible and would likely be the same exact problems . So now I have my old G router next to the TV which can come in handy for new network devices ( tivo , computers , etc .. ) and closer to where the laptop usually is . Buy another brand
  I 've had this camera for two months and I love it . It takes beautiful pictures . I 've had no problems with it all . For those who are getting " fuzzy " indoor pictures , I can offer three explanations ( all of which have happened to me ) : 1 ) If you forget to pop open the flash before taking the picture , you 'll get a picture with good exposure that may even look okay on the LCD screen . But when you load it onto your computer , it 's obviously out of focus . This is the result of not being able to hold the camera steady for the relatively long exposure time required when not using a flash . This problem is not unique to this camera nor to digital cameras in general . In fact , if you use a tripod , this camera will take gorgeous indoor pictures without a flash . 2 ) As instructed in the manual , you should push the shutter release down halfway ( and hold it there ) to allow the camera the focus . Frame your picture , and then push down all the way . If you don't do this , it 's possible to get pictures out of focus . 3 ) In very low light conditions , the camera 's auto-focus mechanism may not have enough light to focus . There is an indicator in the viewfinder to let you know when this happens . However , this is generally not a problem with normal room lighting . ( Note that all auto-focus cameras have this limitation in varying degrees . )
  Not only did this stereo not work , it started smoking when I had it plugged in for less than 5 minutes . Then when I had to send it back , I HAD TO PAY THE POSTAGE BACK which was almost $ 20 . I still have not received a refund on the product , and when I brought it to my UPS store , they told me the address was a bad / unknown address , but that they would send it anyway and hope for the best . I am waiting for it to come back so that this company doesn't have to refund my money , and I will be stuck paying $ 18 for a package that couldn't even get sent correctly . I am absolutely disgusted with Amazon for the way that they have handled this . You really want your review this badly , you send me emails all the time , but I still haven't gotten my account credited for the refund on this extremely dangerous product that you told me came from an excellent seller . I had a $ 50 Amazon gift card that I used to purchase this product , and I am pretty sure I will let the remainder go to waste . This has been a waste of my time and energy , and I am absolutely sick of solicitations from Amazon when they haven't even dealt with the original problem . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! AND MAKE SURE AMAZON IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY FAULTY PRODUCTS THEY ENDORSE OR PROMOTE FROM THE SUPPLIER .
  Have this 512MB SD card with 2 different digital cameras - Minolta X20 , Kodak C330 . To download the photos to PC , a card reader is that best way to go , fast and reliable connection . Kingston is a great memory manufacturer .
  Well , I shot a wedding and this tape has cost me big time . I am using a new Canon XHA1 and these tapes . I should about 2 0tapes with no issues . WHy did I have to have a failure on a nice young couples wedding night ! ? I unwrapped a new tape , proceeded to record . The lcd viewer showed fine . Upon reviewing the tape for edit , my heart sank as all I can see is blue ! No actual video to be found ! The time stamp is there , and the sound is there , but only blue on the playback . I 'm certain these people will sue me . Wow do I look foolish . I read a few reviews and comments on other sites , it 's the tapes . My cam is new , the heads were cleaned and again , brand new tape . :(
  we own 2 of the same model for about 5 yrs . both of them were bought new , no problems so far . took the chance trying to save a couple of bucks , turned into a big mistake for a lot of time spent to exchange emails / phone calls with the seller for a replacement unit .. also like the other reviewer mentioned , the unit does not come with a factory box , but a plastic bubble warp .
  I have been searching long and hard for the right FM transmitter . Unfortunately , this is not it . While I like the design ( a cord rather than a " dock " that ends up rotating and losing contact in the DC jack ) , the sound quality is horrible . It didn't matter whether we allowed it to scan and select its own station , or we went to one that has been tried with other FM transmitters , there was a constant whine or static . Annoying and very distracting from the music quality . So , back it goes and my search continues .
  Playback with the DVD-2900 sounds amazing considering its price . However , a couple of teething problems exist . First , it 's terrible at reading Redbook CDs . Many a time , a Redbook CD will either get " No Play " or " 0h00m00s " . The only solution I know to the problem is to keep reloading the CD until it finally reads the disc - it might take up to 100 reloads though . Second , it doesn't read SACDs that well either , especially the hybrid ones . While it doesn't have the same " No Play " or " 0h00m00s " problem upon loading as for Redbook CDs , it does ever so often just pause in the middle of a track . Then , one of two things will happen - it will either continue playing the track after a few seconds of pausing , or it will go into " No Play " mode . And it does this at exactly the same spot for each disc . It 's not a problem with the disc because my other SACD players play back the discs just fine . As this seems to be a problem with Denon Universal PLayers in general , I suggest you read the various forums about problems with the various Denon players before buying them .
  I picked this battery charger up after reading Jeff Atwood 's great post on rechargeable batteries over at Coding HorrorThis charger packs lots of great features in for an incredibly low price : LED display , variable charging current ( charge safer or faster ) refresh mode , universal input ( so it will work in the US , EU , Japan , South America , Africa , and the International Space Station ) , a carrying case , and even a starter pack of AA and AA rechargeable batteries . It is awesome to watch your batteries charge , since you can page through data on each battery including current load , input voltage , and charging time thus far . But the killer app of this charger is refresh mode , where the charger rapidly cycles between discharge and charge , fully draining the battery many times , then finally charging it all the way up . This feature is designed to combat the memory that NiCD and NiMH batteries can build up , and I am happy to report that it has worked as advertised for eight old batteries that I had that would not hold a charge . Now the sets hold 1400mA and 2400mA , respectively ( their original capacity rating ) . This charger is easy on your wallet , easy on your batteries , and thus easy on the Earth . Eco-Geeks of the world , let your powers combine and .. buy this charger . ( Wow , I miss Captain Planet ! )
  The camera is a jewel . Unfortunately it comes with a totally useless memory card which you should rush out to replace with a 256 or 512 . For me , this is a Canon upgrade because I wanted the stabilizer function and some other features I was willing to trade for the heavier and larger camera . It was a good move . Enjoy .
  This micro SD drive offers me plenty of space to essentialy turn my phone into a small MP3 player . I don't keep it completely full because I also have my phone save all pictures and videos to it and I 've never run short on memory yet .
  I noticed some negative reviews from high-speed , high-volume copying users . I do a few CD 's here and there and these are working fine for me and my iMac . They print fine and copy well . No problems for the light to medium volume copier .
  I have had this mouse for only a few days . It works well with no installation involved . The absence of a trackball to do the job lessens the parts for wear and tear . I hope it works well for a long time .
  I don't know if it is only mine , but in about 10 % trips it lost the way , one of the obvious mistakes happened near my house . The real distance was less than a mile straigh but GPS made me turn and it took me around by small one-way streets for 30 min till I gave up . And what 's worse my husband trusted it to take him to Newark airport and it took more than 2 hours ( instead of 1 hour ) and he almost missed his plane . I don't know if I can return it and try maybe TomTom GPS . I have 2 friends with Garmin that also lose their ways from time to time . I did not find any other problems with the device , I think interface is easy and unless it loses way totally - it is perfect in making D-tours and finding places . Though it 's own database is very poor , for example it can not find TARGET store in White Plains , NY that was opened 5 years ago , therefore one has to find the exact address and go by it . In my experience it also could not find Staples , Bestbuy in Scarsdale and Wal-Mart . I don't even try to locate small stores . Well .. anyway it is better than nothing and in case of emergency maybe a lifesaver .
  I bought a much more expensive binocular than this , but this one is as good as the expensive one . I 'll be using it for concerts etc . Great product for little money !
  I love this lens ! It has such high quality glass and a stunning macro setting ! its has such chrisp and clear colors , and the focal length is phenomenal ! Not to mention the durability . Photo 's taken with my Canon T3iPro 's : Strong , looks good , amazing build quality , amazing photo quality , easy , fast , lightCon 's : after the macro setting is enguaged , it tends to become less sturdy , as in the lens will fall back in , I wish it had a lock on it .
  This TV is nothing but trouble . First the DVD stopped working , now the picture is only black and white . Twice in the shop in the first 6 months . The GEEK Squad at Best Buy said they see these a lot . Toshiba normally makes a great product . This one is not . If I could give it a zero I would . Now Toshiba want to sell me an extended warranty and I think I had better buy it . Another $ 100.00 but it 's that or throw it away the next time it breaks .
  I bought 4 DV-32 's for my 5.1 system . I am using 2 in the front ( DV-32B ) and 2 in the rear ( DV-32W ) . I needed something small and these seemed to fit the bill . Price vs . performance is very good . At first I thought the speakers sounded too bright but once I got my sub-woofer set I am very pleased . My days of listening so loud that my ears bleed are long behind me but these little guys have handled the loud parts of the movies I tested just fine . These speakers have a very pleasant sound ( as long as you use a sub-woofer ) without spending an arm and a leg . In my opinion , if your looking for a small inexpensive speaker , you can't go wrong with these little gems .
  The 8 and 5 port switches are all gigabit , but the 26 port only has 2 gigabit ports , and the rest at 100mbps . This isn't very clear when you come in via the 8 or 5 port switches . I bet it is a great product otherwise but this is bunk .
  Was not impressed with this item . The legs were ok , but the head was crap ! It broke and fell apart after a couple uses . If you want these legs , they are fine . If you love your gear , DO NOT use this head !
  It has been like a time vacuum ( my time swept away ) trying to get this thing to work . It has not worked correctly since I got it . Does not hot sync correctly . Programs are lost . Palm support was no help ( on-line or on phone ) . Amazon , where I purchased it , is immovable with regard to refunding my money-only 80 % refund . I have no more time to play with this . This is my third PDA , thought I was upgrading , but got a lemon .
  i put this unit on my panasonic plasma . it has fantastic features and plays every disk and file type i have tried . updating the firmware was easy and i recommend doing it first thing . i would take a better back lighted remote over the included cables . problem soved with logitech harmony remote . i love that oppo is out there to extend the life of my sd-dvd collection . when i get a 1080p set , a new oppo will soon follow . i highly recommend this product .
  This CD player is pretty good . It has nice sound quality , the headphones are good , and dispite what other reviewers are saying mine doesn't skip at all ( even on some of my scratched CD 's ) and it works fine after 6 months of having it . It has the usual features that I have come to expect from portable CD players such as bass boost , random and programmable track orders , etc .. Generally , this is a great CD player for anyone . The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because someone recently stole my CD player and my new one is really super thin and I think that is cooler than this regular thickness one .
  These headphones cost about $ 50 . The charge light is always on even when it says it is suppose to go off after such a length of time . There is a ton of static recption in the headphones because you have to turn them up . The product is being used literally less than 10 feet from the television . If you are looking for wireless headphones and you have to have them .. pay for a more expensive product .
  This is my 2nd one to buy . using 2 of them as dual monitors . Very clear picture .
  Camera was sold as being new . It had caked on dirt on the case , the flash unit did not work , and it had a package of film in it that fell apart when you tried to remove it .
  Fit our Canon PowerShot SD1400IS perfect . When I bout this a year ago , I couldn't find anything to fit a camera that small for a decent price . This fits perfect , and adds minimal bulk . Nothing worse than having a tiny camera with a giant case . Kind of defeats the purpose . I think we even payed more for it at the time . Only complaint is that the stap is a bit thick for such a small case . Has an extra pocket that fits an extra battery .
  Unfortunately , I have an Intel Mac . I researched this item extensively prior to purchase and nowhere does it tell you that it has trouble with Intel Macs . The only driver on the M-Audio site is from early 2006 and does not support Tiger 10.4.11 which is what I am running . I installed the CD-ROM that came in the box , but the unit would not show as being hooked up to my Mac and I could not use any of my Pro Audio programs with it . I couldn't even open the M-Audio control panel on my computer . I then went and installed the most recent Intel driver from the M-Audio site and it got a me a little further ; I could now open the control panel so that it could tell me that the device isn't plugged in . All of the lights are on on the device but it is not hooking up right to my computer somehow . Me thinks this is an Intel issue . Of course now when I go to research this issue I find all the Intel problem reports that I didn't see somehow before I bought this item . Bottom line , this is an outdated item ( it is a few years old and has not been updated ) and it has outdated software support . I 'm not sure if just the latter is the only problem or if the two issues work in concert with each other . I wish I still had my G5 so I could try this thing out and confirm that it really is an Intel issue , but I don't . I just have my 2.2GHz Santa Rosa MacBook Pro . I am returning this to Amazon and now I will have to start looking for a mobile audio solution again . I knew this thing was too good to be true when I saw the price , and I should have gone with my gut .
  I have a compaq presario 2200z , it fits , and all the acessories ( Network cable , wifi card , pens , etc . ) and it looks very stylish , but my power cable transformer also fits , but with a bulge .
  save yourself some money and don't buy this . the noise reduction is very minimal and it is extremely unconfortable to ware this . The overhead bridge is not covered and the plastic is very heard , it rubs against your head and after a while it hurts . I returned it .
  We purchased this camera for our honeymoon in Hawaii , and used it on 5 or 6 snorkeling / boating trips . In general the results were very disappointing . The camera is rugged enough to stand up to drops and salt water , but picture quality is poor in my opinion . It is also very slow to take pictures , which made it nearly impossible to catch photos of fish , sea turtles , etc . Outside of the water , the picture quality is equally disappointing . I am sticking with my 3-year old Canon Digital Elph for normal usage and will just rent a digital camaera for underwater use .
  Good quality product and works like a champ :) Buy it with comfidence . Wish the shipping cost would be less ..
  For the price , these little buds exceeded my expectations . I 've had my pair for over 2 months , and just recently ordered a second set for my wife . As the other reviews indicate , the sound is full and rich ( after burn-in ) , the units are well-made , and the noise isolation is quite effective . Quiet listening , traveling , working out - this is just a great all-purpose set of earbuds . It did take me a while to get comfortable with the " over-the-ear " configuration , though now it feels fairly natural . I 'm also moderately tall ( 6'1 " ) and the somewhat stiff cord seems just a smidge short - like maybe 1-2 " more would be perfect . These are simply personal preferences , and the positives far outweigh these minor quibbles . The excellent quality and performance at the Amazon price point makes these buds a tremendous value .
  My wife really enjoys this 15 " LCD tv as she works in the kitchen . It has excellent color and a really sharp picture . It is sitting at the end of the drain board and is easy to see , even 15 feet away .
  I have to agree with the majority of the reviews for these headphones . They are a great deal for the money . I used my headphones for about a year with much abuse and they were up to the task . There were many times when I got the cord caught on something and the headphones came off of the clips , but never broke , just snapped them back together and I was back in business . Over the summer I was painting my house while using the headphones . I got very hot and I ended up getting sweat into the volume control . This caused the control to become very noisy when adjusting the volume and it was hard to get the same volume in both channels . I looked at the Koss website and found the information to send the phones back ( luckily I bought two sets so I didn't have to go with out the phones ) . I had to include a check for $ 6 for shipping and handling . The cost for me to send them was under $ 2 via USPS . So the total cost was under $ 8 . I was pleasantly surprised to find a new pair in my mailbox in just under 3 weeks from when I sent them in ! Good job Koss ! You can't beat a new pair of these for under $ 8 and a little bit of time to pack them up and take them to the post office . I would definitely recommend these headphones ! EDIT : I opened up the headphones to make sure they worked and noticed that there was no volume control . I guess that takes care of any future problems with the noisy volume control . Disappointing that there is no volume control . I wonder if they changed the design ? Can't tell from the picture and no mention of a volume control in the description . Still a worthy purchase .
  My current battery didn't hold a charge very long . I charged this new battery overnight . Then I put it in the camera and the camera did not work . Put the old battery back in and it worked fine . Tried charging it again . Still didn't work .
  I purchased this printer in 2003 , and its now 2005 . Ive discovered a few things about this device : 1 . The paper feeder doesnt work well at all . You cannot have less than 10 sheets in the tray at all times or else it wont feed properly . 2 . The Ink is over-priced . 3 . The Color cartidge you can never get full use of because it dries out and you lose a color before you can even use 10 % of the ink in it . 4 . I discovered that you can get a Lexmark Model 70 cartridge to work in the 470CX by prying out a little key in the reciver of the cartridge holder and tossing it in the trash . This will save you 50 % in the price of cartridges . ( If you can even find the 8R7881 anywhere , anyways ) 5 . The printer drivers for this are horrible . 6 . The machine will scare the h * ll out of you if you receive a fax or something prints without you knowing it 's coming . It makes a loud banging from the paper feeder w / o warning when it starts .
  I got this thing as a replacement for my Belkin Pre-N . MAJOR MISTAKE ! If you only need the Internet to check your email occasionally , this router is fine for you . However , if you count on your router for your business or need a consistent , reliable router this one should be ABSOLUTELY avoided . It 's like a kid 's toy . It worked fine for the first month , AND when it works , it works fine . BUT , as is well documented here on Amazon and on other sites ( like CNET ) , this router WILL DROP THE MODEM 'S SIGNAL AT LEAST ONCE A DAY.I will set my computer to run tasks at night and wake up to find the signal had been lost in the night , then forced to tell my employer I did not finish my job because of " internet problems " - sounds like a weak excuse . VERY EMBARRASSING . And now it happens everyday . My employer is learning that I am NOT someone who can be counted on . This is the first router I have ever owned that has COST ME MONEY . If you are a working professional who depends on your computer system for your livelihood this router WILL MAKE YOU LOOK BAD , AND WILL CAUSE YOU DAILY PROBLEMS . THIS ROUTER WILL DAMAGE YOUR REPUTATION . But hey , if you just want to check out the latest stories on TMZ and don't need reliability , go for it . On the occasions it works , it works great . Strong signal throughout the house AND the idiot lights on the front are genius . Why doesn't every router have those lights ?
  as all Bose products are . They do an excellent job of marketing , they hang a high price on he very average electronic products . comparable brands sell less than half the $ . Heard these phone with an ipod over x-mas , I 'm AM an audiofile , sound OK .. should sound AMAZING at $ 140 .
  Generally speaking , I love sony products .. however , I have found that when they need to be repaired , they are never good for long . Case in point was my purchase of this DVD player . It broke after 3 months with a C : 13 error . I took it in , and they shipped it back to me 2 weeks later . It then broke 1 1/2 months in the exact same way . I took it in , and it was fixed for 6 months before breaking in the exact same way . It was out of warranty this time , but because it had been defective so many times they fixed it . Well , you guessed it . Now it is broken again . When the machine works , it is great . But it has broken too many times for my tastes .
  This has every bit of the quality of the hdmi cable you would buy at any of the major electronics stores . The best part , it is WAY cheaper ! I wasted money the first 2 I ever purchased with my first LCD tv , never again !
  I 've had this camera for about a week and have taken around 100 pictures in that time , it 's a solid performer keeping up with my quick shots fairly well . I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive camera but I knew I wasn't purchasing an SLR . This camera takes pretty good pictures with little trouble . The only thing that prevented me from posting 5 stars for this camera is that the body has a very light plastic feel , I read a review on here before I purchased with the same sentiments . It 's a very cheap feel , I 'll get over it but I also know that I don't want to drop this thing !
  We have had these for about 1 year , and have not been impressed at all . Though the layout and design is great and easy to use , the sound quality , range , and mic quality is nasty . We purchased a set of three rechargeables , and one already is ruined and has major glitches . We can scarcely pick up somebody 1 mile away on a nice day , and even then they are difficult to understand . When just 50 feet apart , you can hardly understand the person you are talking to , and they break in and out . The talk button is very hard to press , and because of that no kids could ever use it . We have several different radios , and have done testing with them to see which one is the best . We tested some older 2-mile Motorola T4800 's , a 2-mile Garmin Rino 120 , the Motorola T8500 's , and some 26-mile Midland GXT 's . The very old 2-mile range Motorola 's sound much clearer and have an even longer range than the newer Motorola T8500 . The Garmin sounded about the same as the older Motorola 's , the Motorola T8500 was by far the worst of all , and the Midland GXT ( model 710 ) was by far the best sounding and had the best range . Unfortunately , the Midland GXT that we used is no longer made , but has been replaced by theMidland GXT760VP4 42-Channel 36-Mile GMRS Radio with DC Adapter , Pair of Headsets , Rechargeable Batteries , Dual Desktop Charger - Pair . These are even cheaper that the Motorola T8500 , and have excellent sound quality and range as well as reviews . Overall , instead of purchasing these , get some Midland GXT 's .
  Lasted for exactly under one year , of barely using it at all . Now it 's having disc and door problems , like everyone else .
  I bought this router from amazon [ . com ] almost a year ago . I was so excited to have a wireless network running that i didn't notice all the flaws . I never used any wireless network so i didn't know how much range to expect , but I knew that something wasn't right when my connection would get cut in half if i just went to the room next to the router . Now i 'm stuck with a router that won't even let me access the internet from 30 feet away .
  It was easy to install and we thought it worked until a few days later , when we kept having to " refresh " it . Within a few weeks , I felt like I was using dial up again . In another week , one port stopped working , completely . Now , I find out I can't even get a full refund ! Don't take a chance . You WILL be sorry !
  It was a waste of money ! You can not get a refund too , so Do NOT BUY ! Try a more new product !
  The SanDisk Digital PhotoViewer ( the actual model is more recent than the one pictured here ) is far less expensive than the other digital photo viewers . At first , I couldn't get it to work , but then ( like the other reviewer here ) I went back , started over , and followed the instructions exactly . In my case , that meant plugging it in to the tv .. not to the vcr and not to the tv with the vcr still plugged in . Instead , I unplugged the vcr cables and put the PhotoViewer in their place . I imagine that might not be necessary for everyone , but with my particular tv , it solved the problem completely . AFter that .. turned it on .. inserted my XD card .. and it worked perfectly . It 's a great little viewer-lots of fun for slide shows ( I haven't tried them with music yet ) - and very inexpensive to boot ! Definitely recommended .
  My Radar detector was purchased January 2010 . One month later the detector stopped working and would not turn on . I verified it was not the power source or the cable ; the unit was receiving power but would not turn on . Well I wasn't too happy but I knew it was covered by a 1 Year warranty . I called up Beltronics only to find out that they DO NOT HONOR WARRANTY CLAIMS for products purchased from Amazon . com ! Even worse , they wanted $ 79.99 + shipping to fix the unit . Needless-to-say , I find their level of customer service inadequate and disconcerting given the volume of product they sell through this site . I will not purchase another Beltronics product and would advise highly against it given their lack of professionalism in standing behind the quality of their own product .
  I ordered this product on 12/24 and was advised it would be delivered january 7 . The good news is it came 2 days early . My experience , in contrast with some of the other reviewers , was that the shipper ( Eagle ) was courteous and efficient with their delivery . When I turned the TV on , there was a loud mecahnical noise from a fan making contact with the TV casing . A call to samsung was followed up by a call from their local agent who scheduled a trip to my house . It took 15 minutes to fix the problem and the everything is now working well . This was easily the lowest price that I found for this TV . I love the picture and the appearance of the TV . My message is that it may take some to deliver and patience to work through bugs , but both Eagle and Samsung were professional , efficient and easy to work with . I would buy this product again from Amazon if I were doing this over .
  This charger seems to work but it is not apple branded as it advertised to be . Please be truthful in the item you are selling .
  This is a great way to display the art from my 9 x 12 sketchbook ! It looks really classy and professional
  Sin duda alguna excelente producto , facil instalacion , just Plug and play .. y al instante se nota la diferencia
  I got this at a other store and spent 300 $ . i passed by a cop and the thing didnt go off , but i was doing the speed limit so nothing happen . After that i brang it back . i suggest you should follow the law
  I was attracted to this camera for sports and wildlife photography by the combination of a Leica lens and image stabilization . IMO image stabilization an essential at 12X . Unless you 're dead , you 'll shake . Controls are adequate and , except for the shutter being flat on the top instead of angled , well placed . The plastic body can be overlooked , it seems sturdy . I was annoyed with the SD card being next to the battery until I figured out that it was not meant to be removed for downloading . Card readers don't work = at least mine doesn't . One must download to your PC directly from the camera by using USB . And this is where the manual fails . That fact is never explained and finding out how to download required a lot of patient search . The manual is filled with halfway explanations , assumptions and cross referencing by page number . The quick start gets you through the taking of a photo , but you 're on your own from there . They tell you to read the whole thing before you shoot . Like your going to remember everything . Sheesh . I 'm NOT a newcomer to digital photography - I own and use an Oly E-20 . I 've shot film for fifty years so the terminolgy isn't foreign and I 've had a Mac on my desk since 1985 . I edit on PE2 and sell prints through small galleries and gift shops . I think English may be a second language for the tech writers who wrote the manual and worse yet , they are probably engineers . Be patient and find yourself rewarded . Panasonic would do well to have the manual edited , but it won't happen so ..
  Specs listed an optical out - the unit I received didn't have one . Otherwise it seemed ok , but I needed the optical out so I returned it .
  I have a roll-around desk with my laptop and speakers on it . I didn't like all the wires running off it to my bus-bar . Instead , I got this long corded one and strapped it to the leg of the desk . Now I worry about one cord and it doesn't get tangled in my casters . Perfect , perfect , perfect . Oh yeah , great build and nicely sized , too .
  The item claims to be Mac compatible , and it does work-sort of . Audio output is fine , but the headset adds a very annoying high pitched warble to any audio input , which is completely unacceptable for things like skype . I called Altech 's tech support , and I got an extremely anoying person who tried to feed me some garbage that the head set is only compatible with " analog " signals but that Macs have both analog and digital , and that all I had to do to fix the problem was to switch my mac to use digital . I asked him how to do that , and he said , contact Apple . Ha ! Complete garbage . Buyer beware ! On the other hand , I bought this through TigerDirect , and they promptly gave me an RMA , so that 's the good news .
  One worked , so far the other did not work at all . Very frustrated . I came pretty quick in a nice packaging , but very annoyed to try one and to fail .
  I have 4 kids who are a PITA while driving anywhere . I got one headphone for each of them during road trips and they now quietly listen to their music , watch their movies or play their games in silence :-) Well worth the money .. high quality item .
  Very good choice . With this one , just forget about changing VHS tapes when recording TV series . With the 160 GB hard disc , it has virtually unlimited recording space . Then delete what you do not need and burn a DVD to keep what you want .
  I 've had this PDA for just over a year , obtaining it as an early birthday present in early April of 2006 . In that time I have been nothing but inordinately frustrated with the defects inherent in this device . Defect number one : Video Problems . According to specs , the Palm T / X is supposed to offer video playback . As a football coach , I have literally hundreds of hours of video . I 've compressed these files with two different video compression tools , and they play back fine on both of my computers . However , once dragged through the Palm conduit for installation onto the T / X , sound is out of synch and video is choppy . In short ; it does not perform as it is supposed to and advertised to . Defect number two : Touch Screen Misalignment . The lower 1/4th inch of the screen does not align the pointer properly . This makes it impossible to write notes , or even to tap out messages using the keyboard , since no matter how carefully you place the stylus , the device records pressure slightly to the side . This makes note taking , document editing , and other routine PDA mechanics into an exercise in frustration . ( Indeed , it defeats the purpose of even HAVING a palmtop computer . ) Resetting the screen does nothing . Defect number three : Palm 's lack of support . After contacting them within six weeks of purchase regarding these problems , Palm 's " answer " was for me to shell out shipping to send the device in for repair / replacement with no guarantee that they would not turn about and try to foist the problem back onto me as " misuse " of some form . ( Or the old standby , " We can't find a problem , sorry . " ) Defect number four : Macintosh compatibility . With the Microsoft blunder called " Vista , " more and more people are switching to different operating systems . The Mac version of the Palm desktop is barely compatible with the operating system , and some blunders are absolutely inexcusable : color codes do not transfer between iCal and the Palm device , for example . Notes sometimes do not transfer clearly and are either garbled or strung together as one long note . The only thing that somewhat compensates for these screwups is the use of " The Missing Synch " to offer cross compatibility . Why third party software should be needed to connect the leading palmtop operating system with the number two desktop computer operating system is beyond my understanding , but it 's an extra thirty bucks Mac users need to shell out to get the darn thing to work . Defect number five : Network access . The T / X is billed as a laptop replacement , especially in the wireless computing area . With modern broadband connectivity everywhere , web developers are using more and more graphics and video , things that take time to download . The extremely S L O W wireless network card in the Palm T / X means that it can take several minutes to even load a basic Amazon . com search page , or reference your email . It 's both faster and more productive to tote the laptop instead , since the network interface is quicker and the typing generally moves faster than trying to get " Grafitti 2 " to understand your handwriting . My wife received a Dell Axim as a gift , and the more I played with it to set it up ( also requiring Missing Synch , unfortunately , but seeming to work much better with the built in Macintosh applications . ) , the more I began to like it . Unless I can find a decent cell phone / PDA , my next palmtop computer will be a Dell Axim . Or possibly a notepad and paper , which would still be more productive than the Palm T / X that I stopped using out of frustration several months ago . $ 299 down the drain .
  I got this for Christmas from my grandson . A little complicated at first , but after getting it to work , I found it wasn't much more than just a toy . The pictures are really bad - not anything you 'd want to show anyone . I found it almost impossible to shoot anything without getting a blurred image . Because you have to hold it away from your eye by at least a foot , you are unable to hold it steady - resulting in the blur . Phooey . Just a toy . And one little AA battery sure doesn't last long .
  We were very disappointed with this router for two reasons . First , it gave us a grand range of maybe 75 feet through one wall . And at that point the reception was rated " very low " by our IBM ThinkPad laptop . This limitation made this unit useless for our purposes . Second , we were never able to set it up downstream of our wired LAN switch and able to access the wired network in our home - no amount of " help " from LinkSys 's hard-to-understand off-shore support people or fiddling based on LinkSys 's FAQs made this work . As an aside , we were disconnected twice after a very long time of waiting and then trying to explain what we wanted to accomplish . There just wasn't a lot of savvy in the folks we talked with . Bottom Line - Beware if you need some reasonable range and if you want to do ANYTHING out of the ordinary . Sorry LinkSys , this one just didn't make it . . . GB
  I got this keyboard and hated it . Everything is to close together on the keyboard . The only thing I liked about it was how bright the light under the keys was , other than that I do not like it at all . I ended up giving the keyboard to my grandmother and bought a different one .
  This one definitely has a cool factor . Everyone that has seen it loved it when the lights shine through the mirror finish . I would give it a 5 stars if it provided anti-shock features
  This product does not work . There is no driver disc with it and it is not a plug , or it is defective . There is no disc to insert and it does not work from there even after inserting a memory card . You get what you pay for and I have gotten several products here that did not work now . Disappointed .
  This router has great wireless performance and range . I live in a 5000 sq . ft . home and the router is in the basement , yet I get excellent signal quality throughout the house . It is also easy to setup while having every conceivable option for configuring the security and accessibility of the LAN .
  I bought a PNY graphics card that recently died . The card has a lifetime replacement warranty , so I thought " no problem , I 'm covered . " Sounds simple . HOW WRONG I WAS . I bought the card in December 2002 , so the thing is not yet 3 years old . It turns out that PNY considers the life of a video card to be 1 year ( or so , they 're not very specific ) and refuses to service my card under the lifetime replacement warranty . I don't know about all you , but I consider my computer equipment to have a lifetime of more than 1 year , and even 4-5 years as I pass my old machine on to the kids . Bottom line : PNY doesn't have the ethics of a company I 'm willing to deal with . I 'd look somewhere else if I were you .
  The Lyra is a great concept . Storing vidio , audio , and pictures display . The reality is that the product is not fully functional . So don't expect to have the features that will make it useable . You will constantly see " this feature will be availabe in a future release " . The user interface is clunky and there are a number of file formats that are not useable . If you try to contact Thomson ( RCA ) to find out when updates will be available they will tell you nothing . It can only be surmised that the promised updates will never be available . When you install the basic operating software expect to be pushed marketing information . Buy this subscription , this software upgrade , and on and on . This product is a nice looking incomplete marketing night mare . Save your money
  bad very bad , i bought two and both screens went white , sometimes they just turn off for fun . I 'm out $ 450 because of sony . if i see sony on the street im gonna punch in the vagina .
  I got several packs of these batteries in different sizes , and a charger recently and have just thrown them all out . They are utterly worthless ; they don't hold a charge . And stores don't take returns on batteries .
  I bought the 512MB Sansa Shaker in pink for my 6-year-old daughter . She has long coveted her teenaged sister 's $ 300 iPod , but there was no way I was getting her one . I chose this because of several features :* Size makes it easier to keep track of * Two headphone jacks for sharing with her brother in generous moments * Single AA battery provides power * Pink color would be a big hit * The seperate speaker lets her listen without headphones * Easy copy and paste when adding music ( no complicated iTunes to use ) * No digital readout to deal with ( child doesn't have to be able to read ) She 's had it for a week , and I think it 's become grafted to her body ! To her , it 's just as good as her sister 's . It came with 5 children 's songs included , so it was ready to use right out of the box until we could add more music for her . It also includes one AA battery , a set of earbuds , and a 512MB card . To add music , just load the music onto your computer , then drag or copy and paste onto the card , and you 're set . The battery says it will provide 8 hours of music . In practical use , she got about two days out of it , and that was heavy use . Walmart sells these in a 4-pack for 99 cents . The earbuds were a bit hard for sich a little girl to manage , but my mom gave her a set of earbud-looking things attached by a piece that goes over her head ( it 's a fold-up set ) , and these have worked perfectly for her . The speaker doesn't have a loud capability , so I don't have to wake up to music blasting throughout the house . Not bad sound at all for such a little unit , though you won't be DJing a party with it . She 's perfectly happy with it . The 512MB will hold hundreds of songs ; more than any kid that age could ever need . If for whatever reason you decide your child needs more space , just pay $ 20 for a 1G card later on . The size is a bit smaller than I had expected . It appears to be the size of a pop can , but I 'd liken it more to the size of a salt shaker . Just the right size to grip in a child 's hand , but big enough to find in a messy house . The flat iPods can become lost under as little as a sheet of paper . It comes with a D-clamp to attach to a lanyard , but does not include the lanyard itself . The stores were closed on Christmas Day , so I just made one from an old shoestring . Bottom line : It comes with everything you will need to run it right out of the box , including pre-loaded music , and it has been a fantastic hit with my 6-year-old . The battery life is satisfactory ( keep more handy ) . I love this so much that I 'll be buying the blue one in November when my son turns six !
  When I read about the modem working fine , I trusted the seller and purchased the product . Ever since I 've received the modem and hooked it up , I have been having issues with it . The connection breaks all the time , which I 've never had a problem with before . I have called my service provider , and according to them the service is fine , the modem is the problem . I would like an exchange .
  This bag is very well made and has worked well for me since I bought a few months ago ( the " 100 " ) . I can get my dslr w / standard lens and also 55-200 lens in pretty easily and there is more room if I need it . I can even fit a mini water bottle in the top pocket - just . I was tempted to get a larger size but this proved to be the right decision - smaller is better as long as it meets the need .
  This printer does a great job , actually as well or better than any other place I 've tried . The printer has never given me a problem . However , the cost of ink and paper has really jumped in the last 6 months . The cost per photo just escalated from 25c to 33c . Unfortunately , I will be using the printer less and less . Getting them done thru an online service is much more economical . Shame on you HP for getting so greedy .
  It 's a bit bulky .. everyone that comes into the room always ask about it . But so far it 's been working well . There 's been a few times where I 'll have to reposition it in order to get better reception . Not sure why that changes every so often . It 's a bit annoying but no hard to do .
  No stars-product did not work in my system although the product discription precisely fit the the system OEM 's specifications for memory add-ons .
  I returned the machine immediately when I discovered that the powerful lamp ( probably 650 Watts ) used to scan documents was going to be on ALL THE TIME , instead of lighting up only when needed ( as , for example , with the Brother All-in-One I have been using ) . The so-called energy-saving switch only doused the tiny console lights . Since it was going to be my fax machine it would have been on 24 hours a day . Even had that not been the case , even if I were just going to use it as a printer during office hours , I would not have kept it . I had already returned an HP unit purchased at a local store for the same reason ( with HP at least , you could reduce the factory setting for the time the lamp stayed on , unless reactivated , from 8 hours to 2 hours . ) I find it unconscionable that in this time , when there is finally some recognition for the need to conserve power and preserve the environment , that these manufacturers should indulge in such energy wasting practices . Shame on them !
  Great product as expected . Logitech does it again with a light and thin keyboard , an easy to set up and dependable wireless configuration , and little accessory software to get in the way . Great basic wireless keyboard and mouse combo on a budget .
  Bought it based on excellent reviews and the need for the QoS feature . It had the 1.4 firmware on it , which is known to be flaky and did seem to be in my case . I tried to back it down to 1.3 without success , and then tried to upgrade it to a 1.5 Beta release and bricked it . I did an advance RMA and got another one direct from Zyxel . It had 1.3 and has been working as well as all the positive reviews said it would . So , a bit of a hassle in my case , but it ended well . On a positive note , the shipping on the original purchase was amazingly fast .
  We had a several college students even try to come and help my daughter use this telescope and was still very disapointed in what you could see , we could see the same amount of items with the naked eye if we stood in our back yard , I wished I could of gotten a full refund on this item , what a bad choice for an Christmas present , never again !

  I checked around several places before I made my BM-1 purchase . First of all , these puppies were hard to find anywhere much less get anyone on the phone who could tell me very much about the product . I found what I was looking for at voicerecognition . com where I was able to speak to someone who could explain in more detail to me how the Sony BM 1 would work with Dragon NaturallySpeaking Pro which I also own . The accuracy with the recorder is about 98 % which I 'm very pleased with . The slide switch is great because all the main functions are in one place .
  These headphones from skullcandy are top notch and for a good price . Definately worth the money . I use them around the dorm and at the mountain .. great quality with an added little thump in there for those bass lines
  Only someone who is from another planet would buy this player . It has problems playing MP3 and WMA files . It forces you to use the dumb Sony software . It costs more than an IPOD .. In short .. buy something else . Sony get your act together .. You invented this category and now you have lost it
  I have owned this DVD player for less then two years . Recently when I power it up the power light goes on , but I am unable to get it to do any of its functions . It will not power off and I must unplug it and repeat this four or five times before it will function . Stay away from this one .
  I would have given this product 5 stars , but i had to hack & slash the Ipod Nano mounting adaptor , that comes with the iM7 , to get the Nano to fit . The plug on the iM7 doesnt line up with the socket on the Nano . Tokk me 10-15 Minutes to modify .
  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT . I HAD PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED A COBY5 INCH TV AND WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THAT ONE , SO I LOOKED ONLINE FOR ADIFFERENT BRAND AND SETTLED ON THE AXION AND WAS VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS ALSO . THE PICTURE WAS VERY ERRATIC AND WOULD NOT STAY WITH AGOOD PICTURE OR SOUND . I TRIED TO ADJUST AND COULD NOT GET ANYTHING.I WOULD HOPE THAT OTHERS WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS . THANK YOU , RONALD DESNOYER
  I bought the 6022i 's for my front doors . However , the rear panels only accommodated the 5022i 's . They are fine , but the Infinity 6022i 's are definitely a couple of grades better . Together they convert my BMW 645 into a concert hall .
  The usb cable I ordered was in perfect condition . It was the length I ordered and works perfectly . I could not find this product in any stores .
  I used this lock A-OK for years . On Saturday 2008/09/27 I used it fine twice . When I wanted to unlock my notebook computer from the desk the following Monday , the lock acted as if I entered the wrong combination . I 'm baffled . Now I have to cut it off . Will my notebook computer ever be rid of the lock dangling from the side ? Now I 'll look like a computer thief .
  I hate to echo what everyone else says but this antenna is a piece of junk . I 'm on my 3rd one in 18 months . It is located on the roof of my Chevy Tahoe and the only time it is touched is when I get a car wash . I like the low profile of the antenna but the fact that the last one only gave me 4 month of life is just pathetic . I know it is the antenna because I 've tested reception with the Sirius indoor antenna and my car gets great reception but when I plug this one back it I get the dreaded " Acquiring Signal " from my Alpine . ( I don't want to have an indoor antenna on my dashboard all the time so I 'm replacing the external antenna yet again . ) My setup : Alpine CDA-9886 head unitSirius Connected SIR-ALP1 tunerSystem works fine except for the dang antenna . If you can find a better antenna grab it but most likely you 'll be stuck with this piece of junk until DEI decides to make a better one . NOTE : my review does not reflect on the supplier that I 'm purchasing through . They didn't make it so don't take this as a slam on Amazon or the 3rd party seller .
  These are very good headphones . Before I got these I was using the ipod earbuds that came with my ipod shuffle . They worked fine for a few months but I sweat alot at the gym and the earbuds kept shorting out in the middle of a set .. very frustrating . These headphones are surprisingly comfortable and the sound quality is better than the earbuds . Plus they dont go inside the eardrum which was taking a toll on my hearing , and caused ringing in my ears during the day to stop .
  I bought the 5000 instead of the 6000 only because it had an instant $ 50.00 rebate and the only difference is 1GB less memory . With that said I have the following comments : 1 . Memory , ease of loading is just plain easy ! 2 . On / Off function has alot to be desired ! 3 . My battery life doesn't seem long enough but they did give me two sets of rechargables . 4 . I wish you could delete a song right from the unit and not have to hook it up to your computer to do so . The good news is you can delete one or more songs . 5 . The sound quality is very good . 6 . The owners manual is very inadequate . Being computer literate and very good with electronics helps . 7 . Even with these cons I would highly recommend this unit or the 6,10 or 20GB units ! 8 . Unlike some of the other people , my unit worked right out of the box and has never given me one moment of regret . 9 . It comes complete with case , extra batteries and headphones .
  We are a mid size company of about 220 employees spread over 5 locations . We have other HP products and purchased about 8 of these after they stopped making the 2430 series . Within about 1 year they all started failing . First problem is it get stuck at initializing , or starts spitting out the 49 . XX errors . Sometimes you can reboot and it will work for a few minutes , other times they are just done . These were all related to the problems HP had with the formatter boards . ( however HP will not admit it or warranty past the base warranty ) Do some research on the internet you will see these are problamatic . The next thing is they usually start grinding the gears . I have begun replacing all these printers with hp 4100 models . So far I have chucked 4 of these into the dumpster all with less than 100,000 total prints . The older models are built like tanks , and have a lower cost od ownership than these . The time these thing have cost me in downtime , lost production and personal time have made me for the first time in my 12 year IT career start looking at another brand of printer . I am afraid to buy any new HP printers for fear they may also have issues . In the past the HP 2200 , Hp2300 , HP24XX , HP4100 , and HP8100 printers were rock solid .
  This is a great CD burner . I am sorry that the reviewer below did not get optimum results . Plextor is THE name to look for when shopping for CD and DVD recorders . The BL in the titles means that it is black . I have burned a lot of CD 's with it over the past few weeks and it has not even hiccupped . If you have had problems with it , check the firmware update .
  I bought one of these in the spring of ' 06 for myself and liked it so much that I purchased this one for my nephew who got an ipod for Christmas . It is a bit bulky but the sound quality is very good . It is very easy to use . For the money it is the best FM transmitter & charger that I found .
  This printer only worked well enough for 5 months and than got a paper jam message . I cleared the paper jam and it still says , it still has a paper jam . I checked HP tech support and nothing was useful to help me resolve this problem .
  I have one of these and it will only read the occasional DVD . Terrible product .
  Garmin Portable Friction Mount - Frustration Free PackagingWe have a 2010 Prius and a 2006 Tundra . Using the mount with the Prius our view out the front window is much less obstructed than it would be if we used the suction mount provided with the GPS unit . We also have a wide range of effective placements . With the Tundra we have only one effective placement option and the view obstruction would be about the same as it would be if we used the suction mount . The big advantages of the friction mount are that it is easy to change vehicles and it is easy to hide the GPS when it is not being used . No assembly instructions are provided with the friction mount but the assembly procedure should be obvious if you have read the instructions for the suction mount . However , providing instructions ( it would take a very small piece of paper ) would be a good PR move for Garmin .
  this mp3 player has great playback and holds a reasonable amount of songs . the only defects about this are that the screen isnt lighted and is kinda crappy . If your a hardcore music person like me this probably isnt for you . I bring this everywhere i go so it gets a lot of use . I have had it for over a year now and it doesnt work sometimes . The circuit board is almost fried and the battery circuitry is coming apart . ( i took it apart to see what was wrong with it . ) so overall its good if you only listen to music sometimes but if you listen to it everywhere you go , this mp3 player isnt very durable
  Product did not work for me but I gave 5 stars so as not to penalize the overall product status since it appears to work for those who actually bought it for the correct cartridge type . I was looking for a product which would allow me to view my 8mm video catridges , without the camcorder , and a search directed me to this product . For whatever reason , it wasn't clear that there is no product for the 8mm video cartridges except a camcorder . While Amazon was terrific about the return procedure , I discovered I am not the only one who has made this mistake . It may save buyers time , and sellers money , if the seller made it clear what cartridges can not be played in this handy gadget . I learned what the " C " stood for only after the product did not work . In looking at the product advertisement again , it is not clear that the " C " indicates a specific type of cartridge . It is easily interpreted as part of the name of the product . I am satisfied with policies for return and how that was all carried out . Thank you .
  I was thouroughly embarassed after giving this camera to my 9 year old goddaughter . She unwrapped it , put batteries in it and took one picture in which she couldn't even see on the so-called LCD display . She asked for my help and then we could not even get the camera on to take picture # 2 , as it died . Kaput . [ .. ] ! Now I have to figure out how to return it and my goddaughter had to have a belated birthday gift , once I scraped together some money to buy her a much better camera .
  We have used this DVD player maybe 6 times . It no longer plays DVDs at all - it keeps displaying " DISC ERROR . " Like another reviewer , mine will play audio CDs . I did call Customer Service and once they found out it was out of warranty they would not talk to me unless I paid $ 15 - which of course I did not do . Based on other reviews , I would say Magnavox is incapable of making a DVD player that can last longer than a couple of months . STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE UNLESS YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE $ 200 TO THE MAGNAVOX R & D DEPARTMENT TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE A FUNCTIONING DVD PLAYER .
  For what I need this lens is fantastic . The widest zoom I can get for my D40 at a great price . The lens feels very well made and sturdy ; the photos are sharp . The only thing I don't like about it is the weird finish but that 's no big deal . Highly recommended .
  First impression was nice , the DVD player was compact .. then the little bag was nicely offered with 2 headphones a remote control .. The DVD player smell a lot a terrible and cheap plastic , but then again the smell will probably dissapear after a couple of days . then I decided to watch my DVD and after 2 hours the thing just gived up .. sound was there but no image . I was so upset that I have decided to just pass my anger and kinda broke it .. do not buy it
  I liked it so much I purchased two additional frames as gifts . There are many options and features and the price is great . I believe once you have it you 'll wonder how you went so long without one .
  im gonna be real with you this * dont work its crazy you might wanna consider going to raadioshack or walmart too see one instead of purchasing one onine
  On the down side : there is no on / off switch ( I 've gotten used to pluging it in every time I need to use it ) , it seems that there is no way to make the printer automatically print on 2 sides of the paper , and that the construction of the unit is much lighter-weight than the HP 's I 've used at work and at schools . On the up side : I am pleased with how easy it was to set-up and how well it has been printing . It is fast and quiet . I print 10-20 pages per week on average , So far no jams or other problems . It seems I have a good printer for the price I paid . I will update this review as time goes by .
  I loved this TV , but I am very sad to report that after three months , it began to have sporadic shut down issues ( where it would go into sleep mode ) . Now , it won't turn on at all . It 's just a dark void in my living room . Apparently I would have to ship it back in it 's original box to get it fixed . It 's going back to ( competitor ) tomorrow . :-(
  I bought this to use in trucks to hold my Treo 680 and Palm Lifedrive . I attached it to a steel plate that has enough weight to be stable when I drive . The mount is stable and holds the PDA and phone well while I drive . It is easily adjusted and provides the necessary height to allow access to both devices . The use of the steel plate allows me to move it between trucks . I would recommend this to anyone in need of a PDA holder .
  Yes it is sharp , the big screen is perfect , and it works amazingly under low illumination condition . BUT , it has some serious problem to its ( I think is ) auto white balance . It is worse than my old p5 . Whenever I took picture with large area of bright surface - sunny or cloudy sky , or even light-colored wall exposed to sunshine - but a person 's face is not directly exposed to sun shine , the face becomes completely dark . I don't think the focus area has any effect on this . I can't not understand why even I put the face in the center of the screen , and the person to be taken picture is very close to the camera ( yes , a big face ) , the result is still the same ! That sucks . I am a person who loves to take pictures under the sun , say 80 % of my pictures . This problem could prevent me to take good picture for at least 40 % of the time ! This is way beyond acceptable !
  Using the built in microphone picks up the noise of the motor as the tape winds . Unsatisfactory unless you use an external mic .
  I bought this 2 months back . After one month it started giving trouble with the earphone jack . I sent it back to them . They told it is some kind of cosmetic defect ( don't know what hell that is ) . They replaced it . Again the new one has started giving trouble ( before 1 month this time ) . This time the touch pad is not working . Again they have asked me to send it back to them . Anyone who has plans to buy it , be prepared for this running cost ( you need to send it back to Creative Labs once every month spending you own money , $ 6.50 in my case ) .
  In the picture the plastic case looks like the outter edge is silver to match the inside of the subaru . Its Not ! Its black . You guys should really update the pictures to let us see the actual color of the item . Thanks ..
  had to replace my epson 2400 which i have owned afew years .. at first i was not to happy it quit working but now i cann't be happier that it did .. this scanner is so much simpler and time saving for me .. i have alot of pictures i am saving .. i bought at the staples store which was less than amazon , costco and staples on line .. i am a happy camper ..
  After such high hopes , I have been nothing but disappointed in this product . At first I could not get it to work with my small Sylvania TV . I tried not only the five codes given in the book , but all of the codes . I could , however , set up the SONY VCR connected to the TV . After sending an email to the company , I received instructions ( pretty much the same as the book ) to set the remote up . After numerous tries , it worked . However , the remote only works occasionally for the TV , some days off and some days on . It works all the time for the VCR . At least , it was not expensive , but I hate the thought of having to purchase another one and going through the same process again .
  The TV Ears has been a great thing for our family . We can enjoy watching TV together at a ' reasonable ' volume while the one who likes the volume turned up very high is able to set it how he wants .
  I bought these after struggling with any number of other headphone and earbud configurations . I prefer an over-the-ear headphone . These are comfortable , have sound better than many headphones offered at similar prices . I do like how they retract both the cable that plugs into your music device , but also the cable between the headphones . The fragile parts of the headphones seem to be the wires themselves which are surprisingly small and the retraction mechanism . I 'm happy with it now , but I suspect they will have a premature death when one of these weak spots fails . In summary I think I got a great product and a good value , even when considering my concerns about the fragility .
  This is the worst networking prodict I have ever had . I highly do NOT reccomend it . I would reccomend the WUSB54G . ( It uses a USB port . )
  but I was so close to smashing this thing against the wall . It won't work unless you keep pushing the adapter into the cooler .
  It works .. the only issue is that the cradle currently shipped with the Magellan 2200T is different than shown in the instructions and you have to place the gps in the cradle before screwing it to the base rather than after . It holds , easy to position , move from car-to-car , and to move and keep out of sight when parked in a public area .
  This is the 2nd pair I have owned . The first pair lasted 4mos . & the 2nd pair has lasted barely 3mos . I live in NYC & use my IPod a lot & the headphones cannot take normal wear-and-tear . One earphone always dies .
  It looks cool and it 's easy to carry , but that is about it . Camera is slow and pictures are often blurry . Sorry I wasted my money on this one . Get one of the new ones with VR so you don't have that issue .
  At a first glance , the PS101 is a useful device and good purchase . However , up to and including the current version of the firmware ( Version 6026 ) the device has a flawed implemention of TCP sockets . Which means , you cannot talk to the device if you are using any kind or brand of port firewall with Stateful Packet Inspection , such as the built-in firewall in XP ( or XP SP1 or XP SP2 RC ) . This means , do not purchase the PS101 if you plan to use it on a machine with a port firewall ; or check Netgears web site if they have a fix . I will return my device and my view is that it 's simply incompatible with XP .
  The PA-1 is one of the smallest , and best looking players on the market . The sound is good , the memory is as good as most comparable players and the features are well designed . However , the software , RioPort Audio Manager , is worse than worthless : it may be impossible for you to install and will almost certainly cause you headaches . In addition , Compaq has designed their web site in such a way as to almost make it impossible to contact them for support for this product . Think twice before buying the PA-1 .
  When I bought a printer last year , I purposely purchased a printer that had separate ink tanks so that I wasn't wasting my money throwing out whole ink cartridges that still had ink left in one color but not another . I am extremely impressed with Canons . It 's extremely easy to install , lasts for a decent enough time , and the quality of the ink is very good . Best of all , amazon has the best prices !
  I bought this product after seeing a review in a Men 's Health magazine . The antenna was easy to install , but I received not a single channel . Called customer support and they were of no help . Boxed it up and sent it back the next day . Waste of money and time .
  THE GOOD NEWS .. IT HAS ENOUGH POWER TO BLOW THE WALLS DOWN OR HEAR ALL AT A WHISPER . I HAVE 7 SPEAKERS HOOKED TO IT AND IT IS GREAT . CRISP AND CLEAN . RIGHT AND LEFT FRONT AND CENTER JBL 'S . REAR SURROUND RIGHT AND LEFT JBL 'S AND A BIC CENTER . POLK POWERED 8 INCH SUB WOOFER . I SIMPLY RAN MY AUDIO OUT FROM THE TV TO THE RECEIVER SO VCR , DVD AND TV ARE AUTOMATICLY HOOKED UP TO THE RECEIVERS TV INPUT . THEN I USED A CD CHANGER AND EQUIALIZER HOOKED TO THE CD IN ON THE RECEIVER . THE RECEIVER IS COMPLETLY AUTOMATIC AND WILL ADJUST EACH SPEAKER AS YOU LIKE IT . THE BAD NEWS . THE INSTRUCTION BOOK IS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND . THE UNIT HAS WAY TOO MANY ADJUSTMENTS . TOO MANY SOUND VARIENTS TO FOOL WITH . IT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO LEARN HOW TO USE . THE AM FM RECEIVER PART WORKS VERY GOOD . ALL AUTOMATIC . THE TONE ADJUSTMENTS DO NOT REALLY DO MUCH . SO I USE THE TONE ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE TV FOR TV DVD AND VCR . THE EQUALIZER FOR CD . OVERALL I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE UNIT , ONCE I LEARNED HOW TO OPERATE IT . A FAR CRY FROM THE YAMAHA 16 YEAR OLD AMPLIFIER IT REPLACED . I WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS UNIT TO ALL . LIGHT WEIGHT , COMPACT AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT WITH FREE SHIPPING . BUY IT ..
  As a hobbyist and aspiring musician , I bought this solely with the intent to easily connect microphones to the computer . From that respect it works pretty well . It just took a while to figure out how to set up the audio . As for the Cubase software , it is ok but very basic . I ended up purchasing Cakewalk Music Creator 6 after a while and am much happier with it . The equipment still works with this software , but again had the same challenges setting up the audio and had to reinstall the drivers several time for this hardware . It ended up working pretty well with the ASIO setting . Hey , I did not have thousands of dollars , so for this budget I am pretty happy with my purchase .
  I was enjoying my FD-90 and the combined convenience and hassle of having it record images onto a floppy disk ( convenient in that you can easily transfer images to the computer-hassle in that you are constantly changing floppies ) , but now I love it . I purchased a Memory Stick and adaptor . Now , I can shoot away and not worry about having to change the diskette after every fifth shot . I also purchased a Sony photo printer for the computer . I am even more pleased with the camera now that I can get almost " lab-quality " photos from my home computer .
  The reviews I read on Amazon made the camera sound great , although reviews on other sites complained of poor picture quality . My mistake was believing the Amazon reviews . I wanted to like this camera , it is beautiful , jewel-like , and a pleasure to hold . Operation is a bit difficult due to reflections on the lcd display . But the clincher was the picture quality . More than half of the pictures I take in any situation are out of focus . I majored in photography in college and know how to hold the camera still . The focus is poor even in photos at the wide angle setting , depending on the lighting conditions . Very disappointing ! I have a Nikon D70 and Canon S400 so perhaps my standards are high , but this puppy is in a box and on its way back .
  I had bought this for my wifes bday . So far works like the ad says . If this changes I will let you know .
  many comments compare the SmartDisplay with a laptop . in this comparison almost any laptop naturally wins , but in my opinion the AirPanel is a stand-alone product that serves a completely different purpose . the V150 is supposed to turn your main workstation into a portable device , and it does that job very well . no need to sync or update files , one can print while laying in bed or access info on how to plant flowers , while surfing the net in the backyard . the possibilities when , where and how to use the AirPanel are nearly endless . accessing a home network or other LAN workstations ? no problem with this easy to setup and use device . SmartPanels like this won't revolutionize the wireless world , but again i don't think they are meant to do so . it is not a device that one absolutely needs for home-computing but it makes it a whole lot easier and most important of all it adds the " fun-dimension " to it !
  I got this camera 2 months ago , and am very satisfied with it . This camera is just right for me .
  This bag is fantastic for the price ! Lots of pockets to hold the little things , too . I really like the yellow interior - it made it easy to see everything in it . I wish there was a handle on the top , but I would definitely buy again !
  Great product and great value for the money . My 2nd pair . My 20 year old son liked the 1st pair so much that they walked off with him . Also very useful if you travel by airplane as well . Highly recommended .
  I bought this in May ' 10 to extend the life of an old PC with IDE disk controllers . Great price for a good size in old technology . For almost five months it was great . But one day in October ' 10 , without any warning whatsoever , it has stopped working entirely . As far as the computer sees , even in BIOS and even with swapping around the data and power cables and the jumper , the disk is simply not there ( but a different disk is still working okay , so it is the new disk and not the controller which is the problem ) .
  I had to return the product since it didn't work and there was now way of getting any technical support . At least Amazon refunded my money .. thank you for that .
  True it will not slide but very often rolls to the floor . The first or second time it topples over because its top heavy , you worry if that could be a problem . Then one day it happens . It flips off the dash and slams to the floor shattering the control screen . The base needs to be wider to prevent roll overs .
  I bought this Belkin cable to send audio from my PC to my digital TV . It was delivered pretty fast .. except that when I connected it from my PC to my TV , no sound . I tried a different computer , same result . My computers send audio to headsets without problem from the very same audio output port where I connected the Belkin cable . It 's not my TV either because my DVD player sends audio to the TV without problem through red and white jacks similar to the ones on the Belkin cable . I also tried an analog TV and still no sound . Looks like the cable is defective and seeing it 's more trouble sending it back , I am just gonna throw it away . Very disappointing .
  Works great for both an HP LaserJet P2015 and HP LaserJet ColorMFP M475dw . Great price with all the value . Highly recommend for anyone wanting to upgrade their HP printer 's memory .
  Whenever I see reviews of a product that has lots of 4 and 5 stars and also a good number of single stars I figure that this is a product that only a techie could love . I am such an individual . The 4 or 5 star guys are the techies who figure out how the product works and take the time to test configure the product a couple of times and a couple of different ways . Then when they are finally satisfied that they know how the product actually works they go ahead and do a final setup . Again , I am one of those guys . The one star guys are on the opposite end of the techie spectrum and , unfortunately , this product is just not for someone who expects a seamless , painless out-of-box plug ' n play experience . So if you know what you are doing and are not fazed by words like ' router ' , ' ip address ' and ' raid ' then go ahead , buy this product and you will love it . This product cost me less than a 100 bucks . Setup was straightforward but I must admit that the documentation was sketchy , at best . I did not even bother with installing any of their software . Instead , after connecting the unit to my home router I figured out the IP address by logging into my router and viewing the assigned IP address table . Then I went to the ip address of the Simpletech NAS / 250 and was good to go . I highly recommend that you not install any of their software because it essentially gives you no added functionality over what you can do using the web interface into the Simpleshare NAS / 250 . Performance is very acceptable . The unit does run a little hot but they claim that the aluminum shell acts as a heat sink and judging by the temperature to the touch I believe it . I recommend that you place the unit where there is plenty of ambient air flow around it , just as an additional precaution . But because of the fanless design , the unit is really silent which I greatly appreciate . I took away one star from my rating due to poor documentation and the fact that they have crippled this unit by not offering iShare which allows web based access to the drive from anywhere in the world . I am sure that this is purely a marketing-driven decision designed to maximize bucks so in that sense it is understandable but , still , I hate it when they do this sort of thing . Incidently iShare is available with their NAS / 500 product . I have not tried mirroring or striping but have ordered an external 250 Gig usb drive ( again , Simpletech , since I love their quite , fan-less , design ) and plan to use that as a mirror . They have an email alert capability but as far as I can tell it needs an open smtp relay for the mail and I don't know too many open relays around today . Bottom line , if you are comfortable with tech talk this drive will do the job and the price is great . But if you need some hand holding , either plan on getting the hand holding or stay away from this drive !
