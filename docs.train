  Good :* much smaller than I expected . It slides easily into a coat pocket . * great image quality . Even a novice / lazy photographer like me can get amazing pictures ! * easy to use ( see above ) Bad :* battery dies when connected to the computer . Buy a spare . * software program not intuitive . Also - " Olympus Master " ? Creepy . I edit in the camera or using MS Photo Editor or Photoshop . * no viewfinder means sometimes you 're not sure what you 're shooting . It 's more than a mild annoyance , but in balance it 's okay because you 're getting a great camera at a reduced price .
  I recently purchased a Samsung HDTVSamsung LN46A550 46-inch 1080p LCD HDTVwhich I also occasionally use as a computer monitor . This keyboard works great when I 'm sitting on the couch , 15 feet or so away from the computer , and using the TV as my main monitor . When I 'm back at my desk using the desktop monitor , I use the standard keyboard that 's hardwired to the computer . This keyboard costs a little more than most the other wireless keyboards I looked at . However , it got good customer ratings for it 's performance from a distance , and has the mouse pad built in . Those two qualities are what finally sold me on it . For anyone interested , I use an AB switch boxManual Switchbox Db15f for Vga Monitors 2x1 Abto switch to / from the TV monitor and my desktop monitor . In my case , I already have two monitors connected to the video card on the computer . The AB switch allows me to easily alternate between one of those and the TV . Other items you might need if you want to do something similar : 2Tripp Lite P502-006 SVGA Monitor Gold Cable w RGB Coax HD15M / M - 6ftperhaps a longer cable depending on how far your TV is from the computer . Make sure the cables are male on both ends as all the monitor inputs for the above ab box , tv and computer are female . 1Cables To Go - 27412 - 12ft 3.5mm Stereo Audio Cable M / M PC-99 ( Beige ) for connecting your PC line out ( sound ) to the TV . Edit 5/24/2008 : After writing all this about using two monitors via one connection on the PC .. my son pointed out that a vga splitter would be simpler and allow the tv and pc monitor to display the same image simultaneously . Cables To Go - 29550 - 2-Port UXGA Video Splitter Extenderseems like it should do the trick , eliminating the AB switch from the equation . The cable that connects this particular splitter to the PC looks like it needs to be a non-standard M / F though ( looking at the picture ) .
  It does its job well . BUT , I was not able to read it in on my computer . You 'll have to check to see if your computer can read this device .. go to the Transcend site to find out before you buy . It obviously isn't backward compatible . Therefore , 2 stars is generous .. got to be able to read what 's on there !
  The photocyan cartridge ( BCI-6PC ) from onSale is not as advertised ( it is not a Canon product ) , does not work , and is pure junk . Beware .
  This came with a new pc I bought a couple of years ago . Since I didn't need the printer at the time I left it in the box . When I needed to replace an older printer that stopped working I pulled this out and put it to use . It worked for one month before I got an error message that I need to take out and check the color cartridge . i replaced it with a new one and still get the same message . Called Hp and of course the warranty is up and it 'd be cheaper for me to purchase a new one .
  I totally agree with the reviewer from Harrisburg , Pa ( June 24 ) . The SonyDCRHC40 that I purchased from Best Buy had too much motor noise for my liking . Of course , the motor noise occurs when a tape is in the camcorder and is recording or playing . It was my luck that the camcorders at Best Buy were locked where the tape goes in for security reasons and when I turned on each of the Sony camcorders without a tape in them , there was no noise . So I bought the SonyDCRHC40 . When I began taping a dance recital the noise was terrible . I was charged a restocking fee to return that camcorder and then told that ALL camcorders make the motor noise . Well , I am now trying a tape in each camcorder I look at and there are camcorders that do not make the noise that came out of the Sony . So , buyers beware . Try the camcorder with a tape in it before you make the purchase .
  I have been using my Dymo label maker for several months now and this tape just can't be beat ! The printing is great and the backing peels off very easily .
  This is one of those great deals where the looks and interface perform better than the price . My only complaint is that the signal is sometimes weak in my Audi , while in the Dodge truck it 's flawless . I believe it has more to do with the film applied to the thick windshield than the GPS as this problem has occurred with previous units . When the GPS has difficulty finding a signal I simply open the sunroof or window and the problem disappears . Besides that , the interface is one of it 's best features . It 's very intuitive and has large buttons to operate without focussing on it too long . The graphics and maps are very up-to-date .
  Bought this UV filter to protect my Nikon 24-70 f2.8 lens and so far I 'm satisfy with the purchase .
  Vienen 100 hojas , limpias los negativos los guardas alli , los pones en un folder y se mantendran en perfectas condiciones , buen producto
  I bought these headphones for online gaming - ventrillo , and such - I am quite impressed . I recommend them .
  The software that comes with this printer is AWFUL . It hangs up for no reason and I have to reboot my PC to clear the print queue . It has annoying behavior , for example when you print double sided it immediately presents a popup window telling you to flip the pages when the first set it finished . The problem is you can't minimize this window and do something else on your pc . You have to wait until all pages finish printing . Extremely annoying . I have had to throw away two cartridges due to the " cartridge not intended " issue . I know I installed HPs patch after the first time , but it did not work . This is absolutely the last HP product I will ever buy .
  I bought this new , over 3yrs ago , for around $ 69 , and it has served me quite well . I don't need to do a great deal of faxing , but it does the job , prints fine ( I don't use it to print pics ) , copies great , & scans ok , too . I order replacement ink from a third party company , saving almost 80 % from the retail cost , and it 's been fine , too . All in all , I couldn't much ask for anything more . If I did a tremendous amount of printing , I 'd probably go laser , & I wanted to print lots of pics , I 'd most certainly step up to something else , but for what this unit does , I 'm quite satisfied . And when I 've had any questions , they have been very good about support ..
  I had an old computer without a USB port , so this was the perfect solution . It even came with all the software I needed . The installation instructions were easy to follow .
  Router was an acceptable product for just over one year . One and one-half months after the warranty expires , so does this router . I took pains to avoid Netgear in the replacement of the product . Maybe you should too .
  I was originally looking at a pair of in-ear headphones with a head-band for use in working out and ended up with these by mistake . Overall sound quality is average to good with noteworthy enhancement in Bass response and the obvious sound isolation you would expect from an in-ear sealed design . Not on par with Sure or other higher end models . Physical design is disappointing . They don't feel particularly secure in my ears even with the smaller silicone inserted ( BTW I am 6'2 " ) , and for reasons known only to Sony and some Asian design engineers hopped on a coffee and Sake buzz , the earphone cords are of an un-even length which places all of the hanging-pressure of the headphones on only one ear , making them more likely to pull out . The cord is also quite short ( less than two feet ) and will not allow you to hang a music player off your beltline without the additional extension cord they provided . I can see the logic process here was geared towards people using the player around their neck or arm perhaps ? But the poor / uneven cord design coupled with the extension cord makes using the extension cord an unpleasant experience . Overall I 'd say if you are stationary this weird design would be acceptable but not optimal , if you are walking aruond at all ( what a crazy idea for PORTABLE music player ) , it is not acceptable at all .. For that reason I cannot recommend this pair of headphones ..
  I like to be prepared for any connection possibilitiesSo , when I use 1 connector / adapter I always order a new one to keep in my stash of back-ups . This seems to be of decent quality . Exactly what I expected .
  Finally got around to assembling this . Ordered it too long ago to return , or I would . Thought this was the same pit a friend had got .. But it is a cheap knockoff . Thin metal , poor alignment of the screw holes and the seams . Rim around edge is multiple pieces and screwed on instead of welded on . So are the legs . Doesn't come with a cover .. And you don't want to get water in this so you need to get one . Overall .. Disappointed . I will use it .. But it looks like it will wear / rust out in a couple of years and I will need to replace it . Suggest you search for similar items that are better made .
  This is a bad headphone radio for people who listen while exercising . The earpiece hurts and digs into ears and head in about 2 minutes . There is no foam around the earpiece either , just hard plastic . You need that foam to absorb sweat when you exercise . Get the SRF-HM33 instead .
  I bought mine 2 months ago , and for no reason at all , while i was taking some vids through my camera , it stopped functioning . I was unable to read the device and now its waiting to end up in the bin . The travelite works fine so far .
  This product is bad . Returned it right away . The signal drops . Additionally , there is ghosting across the screen on both monitors . My display was simple 1280x1024 .
  I was looking for an inexpensive fax / copier since I already have several printers . The price on this all in one fax / copier / printer / scanner caught my eye . The favorable reviews that others left made me buy the Canon MP530 . I have used the copy , scan and fax functions and all work great .
  I bought the CR79 because I wanted something that would look nice in my paneled livingroom . I chose this model specifically because of the external speaker outputs . I thought that if I did not like the sound quality of the built in speakers , I could hook up my own . Let 's take the features of this item one by one , in the order of from the worst to the best . The CR79 has the cheapest looking turntable I have ever seen . It would be very easy to break something just by inattention . I put a good quality stereo record from the 60 's on it , and the sound was like something from the 1930 's or 40 's . My wife described it as " music in a can " . The AM / FM radio is better , but the sound is all in the mid-range , lacking any real base or clear highs . The reception wasn't too impressive , either . The tape cassette was considerably better . But I had never before seen one where you have to open the door by inserting your thumb into a hole and prying it open . No button to push to eject ? The CD player has better sound than the phono , radio or cassette , but wouldn't you expect that anyway ? Even so , it still lacks range . The CR79 's best feature is its appearance . There 's no denying it looks nice sitting there in the living room . It looks well put together , and does not dominate the room . The wood finish looks like a rubbed oil finish that might not be all that durable . A coat of urethane would be a good idea . It 's too bad that the Chinese manufacturer of these units did not make them sound as good as they look . This unit is overpriced for what it delivers . It is not a sound system at all , but really just a home decoration item . I returned it to Amazon the next day and ordered the TEAC DC D6300 . It is everything the Crosley is not and five dollars cheaper as well .
  I bought this printer in April after reading many positive reviews . It was easy to set up-even for a " technophobe " like me . I managed to get it to execute all its functions ( text printing , photo printing , scanning and copying ) without calling one of my children for help . Like any inkjet printer , it seems like I had to replenish the ink supply all too soon-but that goes with the territory . Then , the other day , I tried to print something off the web and up comes this message on my computer screen , " Service error 6B10 " I turned off the unit and disconnected the power cord as suggested by the manual but I kept getting that message . Then I called tech support ( also suggested by the manual ) . After a mercifully short hold time of a minute or two , a pleasant technician had me verify that there was no paper jam and then told me that my unit would need servicing . Since it was still under warranty , I could have Cannon ship me a refurbished model and I could ship them back my printer or I could take it to a computer repair shop and have them fix it at Cannon 's expense . I chose the second option . These printers have been out for less than a year and already Canon has a supply that have had to be " refurbished . " This makes me think that this model has some real design flaws or , as I said to the tech support person , it 's junk .
  Nice for the wireless home w / more than one computer . I have three wireless computer on a N network . Once I did get the install disk to work the rest was easy and everything prints from the network .
  I bought this months ago for $ 12.99 ! Included the Sennheiser earbuds . MP3 Music quality is great through those , or connected to quality PC speaker system ( with subwoofwer ) . FM radio quality was fair ( no real antenna ) , and recording Mic or from radio was weak . But I bought it for the MP3 - and LOW price . Of course , the screen is too small for middle aged people such as myself to read without glasses , and the 700 mAh Ni-Cd battery I use barely powers it for 8 hours .. but what do you expect for $ 13 . If I had paid more , I would expect a larger display , and the ability to both play and recharge a rechargeable battery when plugged into PC or other USB power source ( AC wall adapter or Auto adapter ) . ALSO , I expect newer units will accept SD MICRO cards , so they won't stick out from the case . Overall , I would buy again ( for same price ) , or for a gift for someone .
  I purchased the internal version DRU-710A of this drive about a week ago . I didn't buy the drive from Amazon - so don't blame them for the bad service part . But after the experience I have just had I wanted to alert anyone who is considering buying a SONY to think twice ! My problem with the drive is that I can write to it - or at least I appear to be writing to it - but then I am unable to read anything . I have blazed through 20 CD 's and still no luck . I found some evidence on various consumer postings that I was not alone in my frustration which only half way consoled me since I was now faced with needing to get my money back . I purchased the DRU-710A from MWave . com along with several other items in the construction of a new system . First of all , unless you want damaged , defective , dented goods ( not just this drive that did come sealed in a Sony box ) - don't ever buy anything from that company . And returning items to them is like pullilng teeth . When I attempted to return the Sony DRU-710A I was told that since it was a Sony product I would have to return it to Sony directly . I realized immediately that I was in it for the long haul . So , I called Sony . I talked to someone for about 10 minutes after spending a few minutes talking to an automated voice which attempted to help me with my computer problem unsuccessfully and then spending 10 minutes on hold . I naturally didn't get anywhere . He then told me to call the " returns " department . Of course , the number I called wasn't the returns department . I talked with them for a while and realized they were not able to help . I explained that as a consumer of a Sony product - that I did believe that they would want to satisfy me . By the way , I thought I had just received a lemon and bought the same drive at Best Buy - only to find out that it had the same problem . Best Buy gave me a full refund though . Again , the representative at Sony said that I should call the " returns " department . So I was given another number and called them . I did manage to stay cool , calm and collected throughout this process even though I had been on the phone for about 45 minutes by this point . I talked to another person and seemed to be getting nowhere - so I asked if there was a " returns " department at Sony - her answer " NO " . Well , at least she was able to tell me that . So again I went through my spiel to guilt her - kindly - into thinking that I should be able to get some satisfaction from Sony and that I shouldn't just be out $ 100 . She agreed and compiled with my request to transfer me to a supervisor . Interestingly enough I was transfered to the very same person I started with . I spoke to him for another 10 minutes - he agreed to transfer me to a supervisor - at least I had advanced to having them transfer me instead of me calling a different number every 10 minutes . I started speaking to a " supervisor " - he told me that he couldn't help me that he didn't deal with peripherals like DVD 's and that I would have to call someone else . I asked him if he was a supervisor and he said " NO " . Another no - two in a matter of over an hour . These people are good . They avoid the word " NO " whenever possible and just keep transferring - and they do stay calm and somewhat polite - even though you get the impression they aren't listening most of the time . That is at least more than I can say for MWave . com personnel who are insolent and rude before they get on the phone . Anyway , before being transferred again I asked this last guy at Sony if he would recommend that I just suck it up and face the fact that I was not going to get my money back - he said that I would probably not get a refund but that he really couldn't help me because he didn't work in the peripherals section of sony .. Well , my last recourse is to ask for a charge back from American Express on my purchase . Hope that works . The point of all this is to let everyone know that SONY is selling defective drives . Read some of the other reviews on Amazon - I sure wish I had before I thought to purchase a Sony drive . And if Amazon or any other reseller doesn't give you your money back then don't bother even contacting Sony . Go straight for the charge back option or just suck it up and face the fact that you just lost your money . I am having a hard time realizing that Sony is not only not standing behind its product but that nobody seems to care that I am an unsatisfied customer and that that fact alone is going to hurt future business .
  I gave these speakers as a gift to my husband , he has been thrilled with them . He is an avid gamer and they work great with all of his games . Highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for 2.1 speakers .
  First problem : THIS ONLY WORKS WITH THE MAGIC PAPER ! That 's right , after the 60 pages of paper that ship with the pen run out , you have to buy special paper ( 80 sheets for $ 10 , plus about $ 6 S / H , which works out to $ 0.20 cents per page ) . The pen does not digitize anything you write on regular paper . So this really is the gift that " keeps on giving " .. Personally , I require far more flexibility than being forced into using certain specialty paperstock - exceptionally expensive paperstock at that . Where I 'm from , we 'd call this a scam . Beyond that , I was unimpressed with the ergonomics of the pen . It 's fatter than most big marker pens , so it was difficult for me to write with - it felt awkward and my handwriting simply didn't flow well . If you must have this sort of product , I 'm sure it will work quite well for you . I have no comments to make on how it functioned on a technical level . For me , the pre-conditions were a deal-breaker . This was one holiday gift I sent back in a hurry .
  A word of caution , if I may . I 'm currently caught in theseventh circle of Gateway Customer Service Hell over anissue with my 400VTX laptop that is covered by warrantybut that the company refuses to repair . Their customerservice has been MONUMENTALLY bad , I 'm sorry to say . Before buying any Gateway product you might want toGoogle the words " gateway " and " sucks " . To date theyreturn over 800,000 results . Wow . Assuming as many ashalf don't have anything to do with the company ( a bigassumption ) , that leaves over 400,000 very unsatisfiedcustomers . Not a good sign . If you choose to go with Gateway please accept my mostheartfelt condolences .. and best of luck ! You 'll probablyneed it if something goes wrong with your purchase . As for me , soon I 'll be giving up on PCs altogether andswitching to a Mac . Sure , Steve Jobs is a jerk , but hiscompany makes beautiful , dependable machines . I hope ..
  I 've had this mouse for about 4 years , so this isn't a deal breaker or anything , but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to someone else . The right side slopes outward slightly , rather than inward , so it 's very comfortable to hold , but when you have to pick the mouse up to re-center it on your desk / mouse pad , those two fingers on the right side are going to slip off . And that 'll go on for awhile until you can teach yourself how to grip it properly in order to pick it up , and even though you 'll eventually get the hang of it , it 'll never be a comfortable / natural movement . Also the positioning of the 2 thumb buttons are off . The " back " button is about where the " forward " button should be , and the " forward " button by the thumb is too far forward , so you have to readjust your grip just to click it , which makes it a lot less convenient than just finding the " forward " button on your browser & clicking that instead . So that button doesn't get much use . But on the plus side , the sensitivity is great , the mousewheel is smooth & silent , I use the " burst fire " option once in awhile , so it 's a nice feature to have available .
  This is the worst and I mean WORST Apple product I have ever used ! I bought one with my money because I was replacing my dead 3rd Generation iPod . I liked how small it was , and since I only needed 512 MB , it was a good buy for $ 99 in May 2006 . But then only a month later , I was listening to it on the bus and it died suddenly . It wouldn't turn on , but Apple gave me a new shuffle . Once again it died and it wouldn't come back to life . I got a pink nano for Christmas and that is way better than this piece of trash . I don't reccommend this iPod to anyone !
  For the price of these headphones , they are pretty awesome . They are best for vocals and listening to music cleanly . Though I have not bought other headphones , listening to music on these headphones allows me to pick up on the breathing and other things that usually go unnoticed on conventional earbuds . They do lack some bass and have a ultra-long phone-type cable though . These are pretty comfy in my opinion and do get a little warm on your ears / tight after half an hour . But you just need to take them off for a few seconds and you can wear them again !
  I purchased this adapter to enable hook up of a scrolling sign . Cable does not recognize sign . After finding this out , I tried to remove software from my computer . It will not uninstall . Have tried everything to no avail .
  My Mac Mini has a mono built-in speaker , which left me in need of a stereo set of speakers . After weighing my options and reading a few reviews , I knew I didn't want to spend a lot of money for casual background music while working on the computer ( I have a dedicated home stereo system and when I want to do my critical listening that is where I go ) . If you are looking for a 2.1 package to be used for casual background music while working on your computer , I must say , these speakers are a far cry from being disappointing ! They turned out to be much better value than I expected for the $ 29 plus tax I paid for them . Keep your eyes open for mail-in rebates . Honestly , after listening at length , if I had paid full price I would still be happy ! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED ! I may buy a second set as an add on for the bedroom television .
  So , I did not write a review for this item before and I am glad because it 's only been two months and it 's dead already ! We have to tap it in order to get it to power our laptop and it 's always going on and off .
  This is an amazing speaker set , which to me , has great sound quality and looks for a PC speaker system . Minor Snag-The tiny speaker connectors have a triangular socket / key shape just near the metal pin . So if not aligned well the connect doesnt go in completely . So it is required to push the connectors well and deep , with a bit of twist . Secondly , the stereo input connector from PC does not need the full push ( at least in my set . ) This connector needs to be pulled out a bit . This fixes the no-sound in right speaker issue which few users have faced . ( its actually no-sound or very low sound in right one . ) Looks like they missed the finer details of those connectors . Since the right one is also a volume control speaker , I think they put the key on connectors , in case the user misses the color codes . but now the slotted keys alignment . Otherwise great sounding and looking speakers , for that price . And those soft touch keys to control volume still impress anyone who sees them first time . 5/5 !
  I have owned this piece since it came out in 2005 . I bought it with the Toshiba 52HM84 HD Television . I have owned Toshiba products for 20 years and have never been so disappointed in a products performance and the company 's support of it . The player freezes almost every time you insert a disc . The remote and manual buttons on the front of the unit are of no use . The entire unit decides when it is going to unfreeze . You cannot even turn it off and back on . Toshiba offers no firmware upgrade or useful information to help the problem . They can only tell you to unplug it , take the batteries out of the remote and press every button . This all does nothing to remedy the problem . It sure would be nice if Toshiba would fix the problem . When it does work , it has a great picture .
  I recieved this camera several months ago as a gift . I had never considered using a Kodak camera before as we were very happy with our Canon and had planned on purchasing a better model Canon Powershot . Well much to my surprise this camera is better than I could have imagined ! The macros I can get with this camera blow me away . The SLR like grip and style are VERY nice . The 10x optical zoom is amazing . I cannot be more thrilled with this camera . My only complaint is , it does have some difficulty in low light indoor situations . This can be corrected for the most part through image manipulation software however . Outside shots are utterly amazing however . This camera is a keeper . It is super afforable too . I highly recommend it for anyone , beginner to enthusiast !
  I purchased this item along with my Garmin iQue M5 I recently purchased and let me tell you , it was the biggest waste of $ 15 I 've ever spent in my life . Upon opening the item , I noticed a cloth along with the instructions , " wipe screen before application " . So .. I followed the directions and then applied , or tried to anyway , the screen protector . The item wasn't very adhesive at all and when I finally did get it to stick , i noticed a piece of dust became lodged under it , and had to remove it . When i attempted to re-apply , it wouldn't adhere at all . I found this humerous as it clearly states in the packaging , " Washable and reusable " . Anyway , I ordered another one figuring it was some sort of defect , but the same exact thing happened again . It was the biggest $ 30 mistake I 've ever made . If you want screen protection , I recommend the ones made for the PSP . You 'll have to trim it a little bit , but they work much better .
  I do not recommend this player . Within a couple months it broke to the point where it will not even recognize any DVDs that are put into the player . The warranty is awful considering I have to pay shipping both to and back from the company . At which point I would be paying as much money as I paid for the player itself . Basically it 's wasted money .
  I purchased this card with teh Linksys 4port wireless router . I 'm running latest version of Win XP and I have broadband internet . This card installed easily , connects easily and performs like a charm in every room of the house . This card perfoms better than I expected . I also purchased the D-Link 650 + 22Mpbs - this card paoles next to the Netgear card . I recommend this to anmyone looking for simple set up and reliable performance .
  I purchased this because I wanted a digital 35 mm slr . I have an older Nikon Coolpix . The lenses from my regular slr work on this new digital model and I was thrilled with that . This camera takes great pictures and is easy to use , actually easier than the Coolpix !
  I like this computer because it looks cool and its the best yoy can get for that price , plus its modems are super .
  ipod 2G does not work as I found out later . The " works with all ipods " line is a lie .
  The DV5500 is a piece of garbage _ the day I got it it wouldn't focus right and I called for help and they told me I was shaking and that 's why pictures weren't clear , I used the tripod and took a video and it did improve somewhat , I put the camera in it 's docking station and about 5 months later tried to use it again and found out it WAS NOT FOCUSING AT ALL so I called them again , the FIRST thing they asked was WHEN I bought it and since it was over a year , they said it was OUT OF WARRANTY and they DID NOT FIX any out of warrantry cameras , in other words THROW it AWAY because no one else does either . I wouldn't buy another MUSTEK product if they gave it away
  I bought this printer for my son-in-law . He wanted a wireless printer , and pleased with the product .
  Nice picture , you forget its a small screen after using it for a little while . We have five of these and there isn't a single problem with any of them , I do wish they would have come with the audio cords too , but they are being using in a library so no big loss there .
  This thing gets 2 stars only because it does what it claims and allows me to talk to people without pulling my SE530s out ( Anyone that owns a pair can tell you what a hassle this is , especially once you get accustomed to wearing them properly ) . Beyond serving its intended function , I find it very hard to reccommend this item bacuse of several truly baffling design decisions . A ) It is HUGE . I cannot see any reason why this device needs to be the size and shape of some sort of bizzare egg case . There is no technology inside the thing that calls for it to be much larger than the average hands-free device you might use with your cell phone . Their decision to power it with an alkaline battery seems to be the culprit here . B ) The clip on back stinks and is not reversable . It is pretty clear that the intent was that this thing be worn on your belt . Well , I use mine at the office and turn it on when I get up to get copies or something , or when someone comes in to bother me at my desk . Unless someone is going to bend over and talk into my belt , having it down there is pretty counter-productive . Since I work in an office where I have to wear ID around my neck all the time , I like to hang it on the lanyard that holds my ID . WHOOPS ! The clip is BACKWARDS for that ! I ended up pulling the pins off of one of those cubicle wall clips and supergluing that to the back of my PTH . That works , but really looks ghetto when added to the already clunky dimentions of this thing . Why not just give it a clip that has grip ? Dunno . Baffling . C ) Battery door latch stinks . It falls open ALL THE TIME and mine couldn't be any more gently used . D ) U-shaped cable orientation is just dumb . Why not make it an inline sort of thing ? Why not put the 3.5mm jack in the device itself ? It is truly baffling . This thing does what it is supposed to , but there MUST be a better option . Whoever made this thing really could have used a few more industrial design courses . The horrible design of this is made even more baffling by the contrast to the superb , and very attractive SE 530s . I just don't get it .
  Arrived on time . Seems like the projector bulbs are what I ordered and they are in good condition . Excllant transaction . I won't know for sure until I actually use the bulbs .
  These headphones are pretty awesome . They do sound great , and its really neat to feel the bass thumping your ears ( dun listen to them at the highest levels , my ears were ringing for days after i did that ) Its true about what others say about not being able to hear anything else when the headphones are on , well thats one of the reasons it was built . I also tested the headphones with my brother , i put them on full blast and he could barely hear it , i put my old pretty awesome headphones ( i forget the brand , seinhesser ? ) and he could hear every detail and namethe song i was listening to . So these are really great for subway goers or those that like to listen to their music loud and not disturb other people . I only downside to me is the price , its kinda expensive but it still rocks , o and if u tap the wire u can hear it in the headphones , i wonder why it doesn that , its like the stethoscope things doctors use to listen to your heart , my solution to that was to keep the wire a bit tight or secured , so that it doesnt bump into things . I truely reccommend these headphones , they are ultmatly comfortable . I 'm a NYC student , my life is music on the train .
  A while ago I purchased the same item , maybe a month , and I received what I paid for : 2 walkie talkies , 2 RECHARGABLE BATTERIES , and a CHARGING BASE for the walkies . In this last purchase I thought I bought the same things , I even paid the same amount of money , but neither the batteries nor the charging came in the package .

  I purchased the TV-DVD combo unit for use in the kitchen and was initially very pleased with it . However , shortly after the warranty expired ( 90 days ) , the unit failed to power on correctly . Push the power button .. little flicker .. nothing . I thought Toshiba was supposed to be a respectable brand . The repair shop I talked with suggested that I donate it to a school that teaches electronics repair .
  Have not had that much time to enjoy this little camera , but when I have used it is fabulous , the picture quality is devine and the technology in that little case is incredible ! I have experienced the outside sunshine problem that has been noted in previous reviews , but a b / ball cap for a visor and it worked great . I think we will have years of enjoyment from the memories captured on this fine device . It is Olympus quality in a little credit card size box ! Am thinking a ViewFinder would have made the price a definite bargain .. but as they say .. we can't have it all , so enjoy what we have !
  Personally the CD type MP3 players are my favorite because theyare much cheaper and hopefully , some time soon , every CD player willhave the ability to play MP3s . D-Link has made a good MP3 player forthe cost . Just remember that you get what you pay for . If you payover [ more $ ] for an MP3 player than you are going to get a featurerich , large capacity type MP3 player . But for [ less $ ] you can't getmuch . Except when it comes to this D-Link branded CD type MP3player .. This MP3 player has a T.Digit function , which I have onlyheard of on this product , that works great . What it does is it letsyou enter the track number of say 103 instead of having to press skipa hundred times . Very Nice ! And of course it has all of the standardfeatures like play , stop , skip , random , etc . I use this mostly in mycar , but when I take a plane trip or something I like to bring italong and only have to bring a couple of CDs instead of my whole CDcollection . Recommended for the value and convenience factor .
  voice quality is very poor as all is garbled - that is if you can get it to record anything at all ..
  this backpack is so amazing my son uses it for school . it fits all his class books notebook and it has a special place for your laptop to keep it steady this is the best 80 dollars i have spent on a backpack its very helpful and you can use it for like 2 to 3 years its wonderful .
  These are just OK in my opinion-the burn speed is too slow to be really useful . No other problems with them though .
  The device worked well and was a joy to use . For about two months . It then refused to turn on . I had to send it back to Archos . About a month later I receive a replacement . The replacement had a shoddy D-pad and couldn't recharge . Obviously nobody even checked to see if it worked before sending it to me . Had to send it back . It 's been about 5 weeks so far and I have to keep calling , listening to some lady who only works there 2 days a week complain about all the problems they have with the warehouse . I regret this purchase more than anything I 've ever bought .
  Their compact size , appearance and superior , and clear sound quality all for a reasonable price make them a great choice
  I got this General Electric cordless sound recorder for Christmas 2003 . This is a great product , It 's got great features , and also I got a six-pack of cassette tapes by Sony . They 're cassettes that I can record for only ninety minutes on both sides A and B on every audio cassette . It costs less than 30 bucks and I like this product . It 's a lean , mean , sound recording machine !
  The card turned out to be horribly slow . The digital camera takes 4-5 seconds to write to it if more than 100 images stored . First we thought it was due to the size of the card , but having bought a viking and a crucial 64 mb compactFlash card we realise that it is not the size of the card , but the brand of card which is making the process slow . We later found following comparison which does seem to support our findings that the card IS SLOW .. $U$
  I love this player ! I bought it a couple weeks ago - yes , it is not the best with store bought CD 's - but that is not what I bought it for . I put 172 songs on a CD , and I 've been playing it on the Rio constantly , with no problems . I even took a car kit that I had from a previous MP3 player purchase , and used it in a drive to Captiva Island - 3 hours each way , 80 + MPH - not a problem . I even took it over speed bumps - perfect ! I love this player - especially since with the latest firmware , I can use the resume function !
  Good quality cable , ends are securely connected through rubber boots . Keeps the weather out . One downside , the cable is LMR-200 and not LMR-240 . A little bigger cable would have less loss but at 26ft its not too much of an issue .
  I pre-ordered the DRX9000 and waited almost 3 months for delivery . Setup of the machine was easy . Thats where the fun stopped . I used a secondary AV source for the input . And again connection instructions were well-detailed and easy to follow . I purchased the DRX9000 originally because of the some 11 formats it would be able to read and play . I could only get the machine to play audio CDs . It was totally incapable of playing any DVD of any format . One of three things happened : 1 . the machine froze and locked ; 2 . the TV monitor was cleared of picture ; or 3 . the machine displayed the word ' Hello ' in the display and froze . In all three cases the only solution was to unplug the machine . The freezing occurred continually . The machine would freeze within 5 minutes of starting any DVD . If you attempted to select a title or use FastForward it would immediately freeze when Play was selected . The remote did little . Its basic functions did not perform and it kept displaying ' invalid ' on the tv monitor . I never attempted to copy or use the write / rewrite features . I boxed it up within 24 hours and shipped it back . Save yourself time and money and try a different manufacturer .
  After opening the box , my first impression was that it was a very nicely packaged unit with slim lines and weighed hardly anything at all . The keyboard was small , but I expected that from a little netbook . After awhile I got used to the size and being without a left shift key . I was excited to try out the Ubuntu Remix that I heard so much about . After booting up , I had no trouble navigating around but found that after about an hour of getting to know this netbook , it just froze up . After rebooting , it would work for another 15 minutes then freeze up again . Attempting to connect to my wireless router proved to be a challenge . It constantly dropped the signal and everytime I closed and came back to use the internet , I had to re-install it to the wireless . There were no instructions other than a brief pamphlet guiding you through the quick start set-up which was no help at all . When going to the Ubuntu site on my PC , I felt at a loss as the procedures for trouble shooting and setting up was beyond my technical abilities and comprehension . After many attempts it finally did work fine until 2 weeks later when I took it on a business trip ( the reason why it was purchased in the first place ) . After initially connecting to my hotel wi-fi , I had the same problem of the dropped connections and re-installing every time I turned the computer back on . Freezing as soon as I logged on and error messages got me so frustrated that I took it down to the neighborhood electronic superstore for technical help . Unfortunately , after the techician 's attempts at trouble shooting it , he found that it was the Ubuntu OS that was causing the problem . Not being too techinically literate and not having much time since I was late for my meeting , I could not understand the problem so I gave it up for loss . I decided to take a quick look around the store and see what they had to offer , being that I needed a computer desperately . I hurriedly purchased another well-known brand with the choice of Ubuntu or Windows XP . Needless to say , I purchased the familiar XP which to this date has given me no problems after almost a month . Granted , Ubuntu Remix may be a great system for some but I 'm sorry that it did not work for me . I was very excited to be able to change over from windows because of all the good reviews that I 've read and would have loved for it to work out . I 've decided to keep the little Sylvania and install the Windows XP on it for my niece .
  Just got one of these to keep in my truck .. my expectations were low and basically blown away once I had the device in my hands . I expected lousy image quality .. it was much better than expected . It 's not a Nikon pro-grade lens but it 's also not $ 2000 . For what I need it for , it 's more than I need . The focusing mechanism is also smooth and easy to use .. I 'll be looking forward to seeing how it holds up over time . For now , I strongly recommend this tool .
  If you are looking for a convienant way to organize your Music , Movies and Pictures the 80 gigabyte iPod is a must have . It has enough memory to hold all the songs you will need to complete your personal soundtrack as you go through out your day . And during those down times when you need something else to watch rather than your own life , you can select from a variety of movies that you can load and unload from your iPod . And when you are stuck with a stranger and have nothing to talk about , your picture library can help you brag how cool your life is and helps explain how popular you have become . It is slim and small so it can fit in your pocket without a bulge and it is light so it isn't a burden to carry it around . I have had my iPod for a few months now and love it !
  I have been looking for a case to fit my 10.0 " Insignia Portable DVD Player ( Insignia is the Best Buy Brand ) . Strangely enough , Best Buy did not sell a case that fit this player , so I had to look elsewhere . My local Target and Walmart cases did not fit ( the DVD cases were too small and the laptop computer cases were too big ) . This case fits my player perfectly ! There is even a little bit of room to spare , but not much . The case has two compartments : 1 side for the DVD player and 1 side for DVDs and cords . I have not tried to mount this in the car since this isn't the reason I bought the case ( but might be a nice perk ) . Overall , I 'm very satisfied .
  This product works amazingly well on my Palm E2 ! However , Navagator 5.0 , which is what comes with the product , is already out of date . The maps are old . And in trying to update the maps , I find that the Palm E2 is no longer supported . It seems the software requires a more powerful device with Navagator 6.0 . GREAT ! Just great . Larry Coffman
  This was the very first mp3 player I ever bought and I loved it . I only used it for cardio and loved it ! GOOD1 . Durable Design2 . Make Playlists3 . Easy to load songs4 . Takes AA batteries ( don't have to recharge ) 5 . Armband ( I strapped it to my arm or to the cardio equipment if I was indoors-great ! ) 6 . FM Radio with PresetsBAD1 . Low Memory ( If you 're only looking to put about 50 + / - songs than it 's great ; I only bought a new mp3 because I needed more songs ) 2 . A little heavy ( Now I 'm just being a little picky-if you put it on your arm it might be annoying , but it wasen't that big of a deal ) 3 . Black & White Screen ( This didn't bother me , as long as it worked , I didn't care ) Overall I LOVED this mp3 . If Rio would have made one in the same design but at least 1GB + , I would gave bought it in a heart beat . I bought the iRiver instead ; it 's good , but you can't make playlists and I really miss that feature !
  There 's absolutely no reason to pay $ 27 for 100 bags , when you can just use the cheap clear plastic office wastebasket liners ( 7 to 10 gallon ) that sell for $ 18 for * 500 * at Costco , Sam 's Club , etc . I just finished a major shredding job with my Fellowes DMC12 , and used many of those .
  I got this router and just after a year it started to become very unstable . It would loose even wired connection very easily . We need to reset it every few minutes . It becomes totally unusable . I tried to contact Netgear technical support and found that the only support that you don't need to pay is an email support . I sent an email then it takes another day or two before getting a reply . It really doesn't work . Along the way , they want me to upgrade the firmware . After I upgrade the firmware following the instruction on their website , the router stops functioning completely . They refused to do anything because " it is no longer convered under warranty " . I had 3 other pieces of Netgear products besides the dead router . It looks like they are not going to last long . I would never buy another Netgear product ever again . And you shouldn't either . The only positive I can say is that it looks a lot prettier than the LinkSys I have now . But who really cares what it looks like . I want good electronic inside not good looking plastic outside . When it breaks , you cannot even get help .
  I 'm not seeing as much improvement in signal reception as I had hoped . Areas that were receiving acceptable signals before now show stronger reception . Areas that were marginal before show little improvement despite all efforts at antenna placement and aiming .
  Got it at a great price . Liked it . Used it , didn't abuse it . But for whatever reason , it just stopped working - way too soon . Maybe I got the lemon , but I can't recommend it - wish I could - just like I wish this mouse lasted much longer before it failed !
  This hard drive enclosure is fantastic . I was slightly concerned with reviews saying that the enclosure did not dissipate heat efficiently , but decided to take a chance on it . I had this thing running for close to 5 hours backing up my macbook pro , transferring more than 500 gigabytes of data . I continually checked the enclosure , and it never got more than a little warm to the touch . The build quality is impeccable , and having no issues with this product . I would highly recommend this product to a friend .
  The Mpio is a so-so player that can be extremely costly if you want to hold more than 2 hours of music . Its a very sleek and cool looking device with many different options and modes to keep anyone entertained , such as the radio , and voice recorder amoung other things . The real downside to this player is its lack of memory , and upgradability . It costs me nearly 75 bucks for a new sd card . :( . I also own a sony NE-410 minidisc player ( also $ 100 ) and it has been much better in many cases . It holds 5 hours of music on one 1.50 minidisc . It has served me better than the mpio .
  I like the earbud travel case - it keeps my earbuds from getting tangled and crushed . It 's sorta bulky given the inside space , but it still works well .
  All this product does is makes noise like a vacuum cleaner but was a waste of my money , total waste .
  This product worked great for about a month , then it completely went dead , and was as worthless as the battery I replaced , giving you about 10 seconds before the machine totally shut off if you unplugged the AC . I called , and Tigerdirect said there was nothing they could do , but they instructed me on what to say to IBM Tech Support , regarding when I made the purchase and what not . The kicker is they wanted me to lie ! I stayed on the line while the TigerDirect person connected me with IBM , and made the introduction to the IBM Tech Support person , he gave them my laptop serial number , ( which should have nothing to do with warranty on an aftermarket battery ! ) and then turned it over to me , then dropped off the line ! I told the IBM person , who mind you knew everything about me from my serial number , that I was being asked to lie in order to cheat them out of a battery by a rep at TirgerDirect , I applogized on TigerDirect 's behalf and hung up . That was a $ 65 mistake !
  I read the reviews and bought one anyway , which was my mistake . It was brand new and like the review said the volume cut out completely at low settings . Never mind the possibility of the batteries leaking the sound from this unit is way too bright ; meaning it has far too much treble . The button functions also do not make sense . Buy a Logitech Pure-Fi Anywhere ( I did ) or an Altec Lansing IM9 .
  I looked forward to getting Energizer-branded batteries for my Nikon camera , so I bought three of these batteries . But , they aren't Energizer . They 're made by a company called Technuity and are licensed under the Energizer brand . After a few uses , they quickly died out either refusing to take a charge , or taking a charge but running dead within minutes of starting to use them . If you want a quality battery , find one made by Nikon .
  Recommendation : I 'd buy this if you want this particular combination of features . But to get the features there are large compromises in performance . In this review , I will mention the Gecko 201 , Quest , and Vista C. These are other units made by Garmin . I own a 201 and a Quest ( early version ) but have not yet used the other unit or the later Quest 's . Driving : When placing it on the dash I am forced to compromise between seeing the display and aiming the antenna outside of the car for reception , since the antenna is in the body of the unit . The effect depends on the design of the car ( how big the windows are , I would guess . ) On the Quest , the antenna flips up and it does not have this problem . Sunlight reflecting off the front face of the unit into the driver 's eyes is sometimes a problem , and aiming to unit to fix this can compromise reception and / or readability . The battery life is short enough that I find a car plug necessary ( at additional cost ) . However , the battery life can be extended by disabling features . It is not able to find automobile routes , such as the Vista C or Quest can do . I find that when I compare the cost of a Vista ( plus maps and plug ) with , say , a Quest ( where these are included ) , they are pretty much the same . So I would not get a Vista if the only planned use was extensive route finding while driving . The Quest is a much better solution . Hiking : I live in California . Here there are grassy hills to tree covered hills . I find that my main area of concern is finding my location when in the trees since in other areas I can navigate with a map ( the GPS does not rule out needing a map , even with the topo map CDs ) and my eyes . I have been comparing the reception of the Vista with my Gecko 201 , and find that the 201 gets noticably stronger signals . This results in the 201 getting faster , better positions , and getting positions where the Vista will not , such as in moderate tree cover , which is where I 'd really want a position . I find that e-compass and e-altimeter do not outweigh the fact I cannot get a position lock . So if your only planned use is hiking , I 'd get something with better reception , and a Silva " Ranger " style compass . I am finding that when I switch on / off the compass feature ( to save battery life , the compass is a noticable drain ) the software in the unit crashes and it shuts off . A pain , but not a fatal one . However , all the preceeding being said , if you want a single unit that can get you to a park , then navigate around the park , and back to the car , this unit is cheaper that two separate GPS units for each aplication . And it nicely fits into a pocket for hiking . I also hear that geocachers like them since they need to get close to the cache in the car , and then take the unit out of the car to find the cache . I could see this unit being nice in that application .
  Delivery was prompt and everythings appears to work properly . Haven't managed to geet all my shows recorded on schedule yet , but that is not a problem of the device .
  In an effort to save money I bought two of these . They look exactly like the real thing but they don't work like a real Canon battery . The batteries do work but it take some finessing . The one thing you loose is the battery strength meter on the camera . I may use these batteries in a pinch but you have no idea how long the battery will last . I wouldn't recommend these to anyone .
  Save yourself $ 10 and buy a jar of mayonnaise , you 'll get the same results smearing that all over your screen . Guess I shouldn't be surprised buying a product from a company known for selling ( scamming ) overpriced " premium " audio cables . A one star review is the lowest you can give . It 's also generous for this product .
  Batteries were cheaper than in any of the stores in my town . Quick shipping .
  Do not even waste your time with this . I don't even know how this product can be sold . I used it for about 3 days in my car to charge my ipod , and it ended up screwing up my ipod . DON'T BUY IT !
  Get this - plug it into your iPod , then into your stereo ; and then .. ask yourself why you didn't get this sooner ! There are NO down sides to this great adaptor , none . Great price , fast shipping . :-)
  Do not buy anything from Pinnacle . Their software deceptively leads you to believe that you need to purchase further programs to burn DVDs . I did so and got incorrect activation codes twice before requesting a refund which they have refused to give even though the product does not work and meets their advertised return policy . I have filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive trade policies and knowingly offering defective products .
  I went with this speaker because it timber-matched with the polk RTI10 's and RTI4 's that I purchased . This added the bass that I was missing even after bi-amping the front speakers . This is not a earth shaking sub , but , is decent and will add the missing bass . No regrets for the money I spent .
  I bought this product based on several reviews when I was researching this . My main criteria was good sound quality and ease of installation . The installation was very straightforward going into our 2009 Toyota Corolla . The wire harnesses it comes with are designed for European cars ( mostly VW ) , so don't expect everything to just plug in . If you want to use the car speakers for sound ( and not get an external speaker ) , you 'll have to cut wires on the Parrot and the car radio harness in order to interrupt the speaker inputs going to radio . You 'll also need to find the radio mute wire if you want the sound system to mute when the phone rings ( for cars that don't have a mute input , you can use a relay to interrupt the accessory to the radio ) . The installation took about 3 hours , and the system worked flawlessly . When the phone rings or when I make a call ( either through phone or Parrot device ) , and car stereo sound mutes , and the call goes through the front car speakers and sounds crystal clear . I was so please that I bought another one for our other car , which I haven't installed yet . Laith Sinawi Web Development [ .. ]
  On the HP Photo Value Pack , the package states 24 cents per photo . The package includes 150 sheets of photo paper . 24 cents x 150 sheets equals $ 36.00As I write this , the price above is listed as : List Price : $ 47.15Price : $ 35.99You Save : $ 11.16 ( 24 %) The " list price " of 47.15 would not add up to . 24 cents per photo ! I always understood the list price to be set by the manufacturer ( HP ) , which in this case would not match the promotional packaging ( also HP ) The Amazon " sale " price of 35.99 , should be the list price . I hope this is not deception on the part of Amazon . ~ ~ ~ I have found that these HP Photo Value Packs are subject to some deceptive marketing on the web because buyers understandably think that they are getting standard volume ink cartridges in the deal . Also on a popular auction site , The HP Photo Value Packs are opened , and the 150 sheets of photo paper , and ink cartridge sets sold separately . So although they are genuine HP ink , some believe that they are buying standard full cartridges . The ink in the HP Photo Value Packs are " custom " cartridges , meaning they are filled with only enough ink to print 150 photos . The standard HP individual cartridge ( from the HP website ) : HP 02 Light Cyan Ink Cartridge ( C8774WN # 140 ) , andHP 02 Light Magenta Ink Print Cartridge ( C8775WN # 140 ) , are listed at 240 photos . So without the original box , you can not easily know if you are buying a much lower volume of ink . Beware of sellers ~ Amazon or auctions who may let you believe that the ink tanks you are buying are the standard full ones . Here is a clue to watch for in auctions where sellers have the unboxed ( but individually sealed ) sets of ink : The sets from opened HP Photo Value Packs will have 6 tanks . If Black is included in the set , ask questions , it may be from a HP Photo Value Pack . Black is often sold separately , for example , 5 tanks in this HP Combo Pack : HP 02 Inkjet Print Cartridge Color Combo Pack ( CC604FN # 140 ) ~ John
  I bought this camera over three years ago and my partner also bought one . It has proved to be all that was promised . Simple to use , giving great photos and with the option of a 60 sec . movie , it covers every situation . Perhaps it 's greatest factor for me is using floppy disks for memory . Always available , and in an emergency , they can be reused . Just a 3 1/2 floppy drive and no cables - what could be easier . Like many of your other reviewers , I just love this camera and hope it lasts forever !
  This work well , however they are still too big for my ears . One inevitably keeps popping out , which makes it difficult to keep it on my head . The sound quality and everything else is great , I just wish the ear buds were smaller .
  I cant rate the battery quality . I only used it for about a month now and it seems working fine . Its a standard size ( RBC-7 ) so it fits perfect . Replacement is very easy . Did not find ony cheapper than Amazon .
  I ordered the AR wireless speaker and headphone combination . They were shipped separately . The headphones arrived first and work as desired . Today the speaker came . I set it up according to the directions and by chance selected the same channel the headphones were on . The XMradio , which the headphone transmitter was attached to , immediately came through the wireless speaker . I am debating whether or not to order another speaker to get stereo . The quality is as expected from a plastic bucket , as another reviewer called it . To be used as a weather-proof outdoor speaker it will perform as expected . I am completely satisfied , but can only give a 4 as I 'm not over-whelmed with having to use 8 size C batteries with it . Edit - the speaker went south . It no longer works and is thrown away . I would not buy another . I now would give it less than a one star if I could change it .
  THIS LITTLE ITEM ARRIVED YESTERDAY AND THE PRODUCT FEATURE LISTED INCLUDES " AUTO-REVERSE " THIS UNIT DOES NOT CONTAIN AND HAS NO AUTO-REVERSE AS LISTED ON THE PRODUCT FEATURE AD ON THE WEB-SITE , SO BACK IT GOES , A REAL SHAME TOO ( THAT 'S THE REASON I PURCHASED IT ) - HAS REAL GOOD TONEAND A GOOD SOUND FROM MAKING A RECORDING BUT WANT & NEED AUTO-REVERSE AND THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE IT
  I feel misled by the rave reviews here and elsewhere . I jumped at this given the price and others ' praise . The latter was misplaced ; the former wasn't low enough . The MM22 might be fine for a hotel room , but it 'd better be a damned quiet hotel . I have trouble hearing the damned thing even when I press it to my ears . Yes , I 've found the volume buttons , and yes it makes a difference - from inaudible to barely audible . The design is cute , the carrying case is nice ( though excessive unless you need to carry all 3 cables and all 3 adapters , which you won't ) , and the price is low . But cheap is cheap , and this one 's not the effort .
  I build and take care of hundreds of computers for a University . I have a degree in Electrical Engineering . I have used many Coolmax @ power supplies . I placed an order for six model CX-400B Coolmax power supplies . Two failed within a couple months , three were DOA . Testing of the units show overvoltage , and lack of voltage control . Many motherboards were tried , the result was rebooting , failure to start and damage to one motherboard ! Warranty at Coolmax says they will replace them , but it shows someone at the company was asleep at the wheel during the production and inspection of this power supply . One star is one too many for this product !
  This product says " sport " in the title , but it really isn't designed for use while being very active . I run on a treadmill at the gym and the sleeve leaves the Ipod far too floppy on my arm . It really bounces all over the place and becomes an annoyance . The quality of the sleeve 's parts are great , but the design is poor . If you ride a bike or are only lifting weights it will do the trick , but I would avoid it if you are doing anything more .
  I read alot of reviews about Wireless headphones before deciding on the Sennheiser RS130 's . I realized there does not seem to be a specific brand that has the ' perfect ' headphones i.e. no complaints . What kind of expectations do we have from sound ? Well , I am a photographer & do not know much about sound ( although in very aspect of my life I am extremely pedantic & perfectionistic ) . My husband is a presenter for ESPN and obviously is around Sennheiser products all the time . My sister & her husband are both sound engineers ( they bought a cheaper variety of Sony 's ) . Ok , so after doing research I decided on the Sennheisers but they were over my aloted X-mas budget . Found a site on amazon that had a better price & seemed to have reasonably good seller reviews . Noise complaint : After fully charging them & plugging them in I tested with TV / Source sound very high & headset lower VERSUS TV / Source sound lower & headset higher & understood what people were complaining about . There is more noise when TV / Source sound is low . Noise / buzzing is far less when source sound is higher to start with . But still not perfect . Then next thing that lessened noise was placement of charger / transmitter . I just moved it away from the side of the TV that had more walls / obstructions & other wireless modems etc . Better again . But for you people that expect crystal clear sound you will be disappointed as there is a very , very slight buzz / rumble but for us it is nothing to complain about . The sound is great , they autotune , very comfortable fit , clicks easily into the recharging cradle & sound is pretty great !
  resonable price about $ 40not so fast to record and read data but indurable !
  I just got this cable . My first problem was that the CD that came with it had no drivers for en EnV VX9900 phone . After I found the drivers on the web , I found out that this cable will not charge the phone when it is connected to the USB port .
  For $ 500 ( or $ 600 for the 60GB edition ) you can get a computer . I think its a little to expensive for what you get . The battery life is better , which is a plus but other than that there is no significant improvement on the 4G iPod , except for the color screen / photo viewing which in my opinion is not worth 100 extra dollars . There are much better color screen and photo viewing mp3 player alternatives out there , at a much lower cost . Check out the Archos Gmini 400 ( can play videos also and its the same size as the iPod ) , iRiver iHP-320 ( bundled with FM Radio , In-line recording , voice recording ) , or Cowon iAudio M5 ( same as iRiver IHP-320 only smaller ) .

  I have been using Sony 7506 's forever . So comfortable . So clear . So flimsy . The cord is not detachable , so I have gone through three pair already with the cord always getting loose . Having said this , after doing a lot of online investigations , it seemed that the Sennheiser 280s were rated closest in sound , have a detachable cord ( feature not available in Sonys ) and were supposedly comfortable . They are NOT comfortable . Sure the ear cups swivel and they collapse so you can travel with them , and they sound almost as good as the Sonys , but not AS good .. So , I will have to stick with my clear , flimsy , but very comfortable Sonys moving forward .. Oh well ..
  When I bought this combo system I assumed that in exchange for convenience and space saving there would be some compromises . Unfortunately there are a little too many . First , the unit cannot play back MP3 CDs as advertised . It lost about half of the songs from each CD I tried , it broke individual songs into multiple files , it messed up directory structure - in short , forget about using it to playback your MP3 collection . It is clear that the MP3 functionality was tacked on as an afterthought - and not very well . Instructions regarding MP3 playback do not even appear in the ( indecipherable ) manual , but rather are found on an ( equally indecipherable ) piece of paper shipped with the unit . Since MP3 playback was a big selling point for me , I was rather disappointed . A second annoyance is that the remote control does not work with my new Toshiba TV . Nor does the Toshiba TV remote work with the VCR / DVD . This is just ridiculous . My main complaint however is that the unit simply stopped working 3 weeks after I bought it . The entire electrical system just shorted out - I couldn't even eject the tape and DVD that were in it . Amazingly , there is a Toshiba certified repair center nearby . They promise to have it fixed about 3 weeks . Great . Update - Two weeks later , I received a call from the Toshiba Authorized Service Center saying that they don't know how to fix the unit . I was told to call Toshiba customer support . Toshiba says they will looking it , but are non-commital doing anything .
  I bought this item to use with my Nikon D200 and a ProFoto studio flash . It seemed like everything plugged in okay , but the flash synch is not reliable . It works perhaps 25 % . I 've sent Wein three e-mails about this , but all have been apparently ignored . Also , this item is not very durable , even if it did work reliably . It is definitely not up to professional standards .

  I was strickly a Palm guy until I saw the Sony Clie . I 've owned both the Palm Vx and m505 . Of course I moved to the m505 because it had colour . The colour wasn't impressive , but it was a plus compared to the Vx . I switched teams and became a Sony guy after seeing the Clie on the web . I 'm somewhat of a gadget guy , so the camera feature was an added plus ( in a PDA ) for me . I have to admit , the colour on the Clie blows the socks off of the Palm . The screen of the Clie is soo much clearer , the processor is faster ( this is really highlihgted when viewing pictures ) , this is generally a great PDA , but .. I do have couple of small points to mention on the negative side . Although the camera is a neat feature , the quality of the picture isn't that great ( but I think Sony has a new generation of PDA / camera coming out soon ) , the stylus is too thin , and on a few occasions my memory stick is not recognized by my Clie , and I 've had to fiddle with it to get it to work . What I 've found is that if the memory stick is left out of the expansion slot for a little while and then re-inserted it will function correctly , then . But , with that said , I still think you get great value for your money with the Sony Clie PEG-NR70v / U.
  This accessory is great ! It make an otherwise somewhat small camera much easier to handle . I ordered the battery grip along with the XTi kit and put the battery grip on right off the bat . The options of using 1 or 2 battery packs or AA batteries is very nice . A second shutter release button and main dial makes holding the camera vertically much more natural . The convenience and improved handling is worth the otherwise high price . I will never use the camera without it ; especially with the 430 Speedlite and 28-135mm IS USM lens attached - just too much weight for the native grip of the camera .
  Better than described , works very well does have a tendency to fall forward but more my fault than the bag , Loved the leather
  I loved this popcorn popper , UNTIL I ran out of the concentrators that were provided with the popper . After looking at numerous stores to find the replacement concentrators , I realized that I was going to have to buy them online . Then , I realized that if I buy more concentrators , I am going to be paying almost what I payed to purchase the popcorn popper , just in replacement pieces and shipping and handling ! I will be looking for another popcorn popper .
  The on / off switch is stuck . I cannot therefore record or review tapes . I pried the switch and made a temporary contact and confirmed that the camera can record and play-back I would like to be able to return it for full credit or have it repaired .
  I had trouble getting the first router to work , even after 2 hours on the phone with a Linksys rep . They determined that the router was defective . ( I found out later that it was a problem with my modem , so probably not the router . ) However , Linksys gave me a case number , and Amazon accepted the return and shipped a new router .. all without shipping charges ! I 'm getting great speeds with the new router ( and new modem ) , and the service from Amazon and Linksys was wonderful !
  Got the palm and tried to charge it . Would never charge past 50 % capacity . Was unable to tap on battery icon to see what % I was at . Ran larger programs slowly . Probably good for basic stuff , can't run big things - maybe I just got a dysfunctional unit - returned it .
  I ordered this product as a Christmas present . My friend like it very much , said it is very nice .
  I agree with the previous rating .. we must bring that star rating of three down ! This router .. I don't even want to call it a router .. This contraption is a complete waste of money ! I know it 's cheaper than many others , but gosh ! It 's not worth the twenty dollars I paid ! It loses the connection every 2-3 minutes . That 's ridiculous considering my pc is only about four feet ( and with a clear path ) from the thing . The router gets so hot after about 30 minutes , the base may actually burn you . Do not even conjure up the idea in head to consider buying this ! Congrats , Belkin ! You have out done yourself with this piece of s * t !
  To begin with I 'm not a techie and I don't know a tweeter from a woofer . I just wanted to copy my CD collection ( and possibly my cassettes ) so I could listen to them anytime , anywhere . I researched all the choices and read everyone 's reviews and decided on the iRiver IHP-40 primarily because of its memory size and comments made by manufacturers that they don't think people are interested in large memory capacity ( worried they 'd stop making this size ) . The first thing to do when your iRiver arrives is to find the hold button on both devices and change its position . It is shipped with the hold " on " which may explain why some people couldn't get it to work from the get go . You should also go to the main menu and under display change backlighting battery and adapter . They 're set for 3 seconds and you can't navigate fast enough before it turns off . The data management system shipped on the disc only works if you 're going to use MP3 files . Its useless if you 're going to copy WMA files . But that 's OK , I 'm using a computer with Windows XP and you don't need the disc at all and the data management system already on the IHP-40 works just great . But if you are going to use MP3 's and installed the disc you have to go into the main menu and under ' general ' turn on the DB scan in order to use it . Another thing to know is that a friend tried reformatting per page 3 and the IHP-40 is too large to format using FAT32 ( at least with Windows 2000 and Windows XP ) so don't go down that road . You can get help online . You may have to wait , but they will answer your question . The phone number they give connects to a machine that takes your name and number and someone will call you in two days . It isn't THAT difficult to navigate , after a few minutes you start getting used to it . The case is brown and ugly . I use a generic CD waist belt holder when I 'm listening . That way its ' secure and doesn't advertise the fact that I have something expensive to steal . I really wish it could record from the radio , but that 's my only complaint . I 've copied 172 CDs so far ( classical and jazz ) and haven't had any problems downloading additions everyday . Have more CDs to copy . I 've also copied a radio program recorded by my Crane recorder ( its like a radio VCR ) directly from the Crane to the IHP-40 . Only complaint is you can only record in MP3 or WAV format and I 'm trying to conserve space and use WMA files as much as possible . Had concerns about the life of the battery ( a lot of money if it isn't going to last forever ) , but there are places online that sell replacement batteries and instructions for most all of the hard drive jukeboxes . I wouldn't have purchased any of them if I couldn't replace the battery , just too much money for throw away technology . So far I 'm very pleased with the iRiver-IHP0-40 . No more messing with CD cases , CDs in a different location from where I am when I want to listen , changing CDs or being connected to a large disc changer ( listen with earphones ) when I have to move around . I would recommend buying this if a friend asked me . I 'd suggest reading all the reviews , because you learn alot about how to work the machine before it arrives . Would give it 5 stars , but that 's perfection . Think it should be rated 4 1/2 stars ( because of not being able to record from the radio ) .
  I bought this product to convert my rather large collection of VHS tapes to DVD-R discs . With the Toshiba name and some good reviews , I thought I had made a smart purchase . I was wrong . Sometimes , when dubbing , it continues to play the VHS tape but it stops recording without any on-screen notification ! Sometimes I get the " Video input system changed " message that others have reported , but it usually happens that I watch 2-3 hours of tape only to find that the unit recorded a whopping 5-10 seconds . If you want to dub your old tapes to disc , then your money will most likely be better spent on a product from a different manufacturer . Shame on you Toshiba !
  I purchased these head phones for my 2 year old and he loves them ! He is pretty rough with them and takes them on and off frequently but they have held up just fine ! I woudl definetely recomend these to anyone .
  After receiving this device sometime in late 2004 , I put it to use as an ebook reader . The battery lasts several books when the screen is turned all the way down , and it can hold several novels in memory at the same time - but who needs the Library of Congress on one device ? Switching files around between it and the computer is dead simple and as efficient as can be , as it connects via a serial port . The color display is nice , and the IR port allows the IIC to be used as a universal remote . ( Much to the chagrin of my teachers ) Here it is now , 2010 , a full decade after the Palm IIc was released - and the docking cradle for my IIc still sits in the same spot on my desk it was placed , six years ago . The same for my IIc holds true . It has served me faithfully , and probably traveled upwards of ten thousand miles at my side . Ten years later , and this brick of plastic and silicon still functions . Six years down the line , and I 'm still devouring the written word with this remarkable device . Although Amazon itself offers an ebook reader , I find myself strangely attached to this fantastic little gizmo . Sure the screen is a wee bit on the small side , it uses a serial cable , and it 's a decade old , but it works . Were mine to break , even now , I would buy another as a replacement . Why spend so much on modern ebook readers when my faithful IIc serves my needs . So here 's my review , ten years late : Buy it . It won't let you down . And tomorrow , I have a function to attend , and a long ride to get there . If you 'll excuse me , I have to load some reading materials on my IIc .
  The was a refurbished product I purchased from the buyer . This cartridge has clogged my printers ink head and / or leaves the text skimpy looking even if I have cleaned the printer heads . I would not buy from this buyer again . I probably will never buy re-furbished cartridge again .
  though i didn't buy these headphones on amazon i still wanted to write a review . i have owned these once before and i thaought for the money that they were pretty good they lacked bass but i can live with that , i owned that pair for 2 years before they died . so i baought a second pair just a couple weeks ago and already the one driver is distorting at low volumes . dispite the problems i 've had i would still tell people to buy them because of the price and sony is generaly a good brand .
  Despite the rave reviews for this product , I 'm a bit more skeptical . I recently purchased an HP LaserJet 3015 MFC and wanted to use this device to connect to our office network . A couple of thoughts : 1 . Toms Networking does a comparison between this product and Silex 's SLX SX1000U . I would strongly suggest anyone thinking about buying this product to read the article . The article can be found at :[ .. ] 2 . Although Silex 's product only has one USB port , you * can * connect a USB hub to support up to 15 devices . The KeySpan device supports 4 devices , but you cannot add more devices . 3 . I found that the unit would experience problems if I submitted a print job greater than 7 MB through the KeySpan . I reset the printer and nothing got fixed . Only when I power cycled the KeySpan did things work . I am using the latest version , v1.3.1 , which also upgrades the KeySpan firmware . 4 . Toms Hardware also reports that it would crash with several different devices . I read on other web sites that the Keyspan software causes the blue screen of death ( IRQ_LESS_THAN_EQUAL errors ) , so I tend to believe that the problem is caused more by the Keyspan drivers than the HP ones . 5 . In some parts of its web site , KeySpan advertises that this unit supports USB v2.0 , but if you read the fine print it 's supporting at USB v1.1 speeds . 6 . I discussed with KeySpan about connecting external hard drives . This unit is really meant for multi-function printers and cannot support external HD 's . 7 . I decided to return this product and try out the Silex instead . Although there is a lot of potential for this device , I would not suggest it for enterprise environments . I read the glowing Amazon reviews but would put more skepticism about their comments now that I have tried it for myself . 8 . I will update this review later when I have a chance to try the Silex unit .
  I purchased this filter for the sole reason of protecting an expensive lens . I can wipe dust and fingerprints off of it easily without worrying about scratching my lens . I use lens paper to clean the lens , and have never had issues with scratching .
  I have a ( now-discontinued ) Lexmark C532dn color laser printer . " D " stands for duplex ( prints on both sides ) , " N " for networking . The C532 series got so-so reviews , and consumables are extremely expensive , we own it and I am loathe to toss a huge chunk of working machinery . I should have listened to my own instincts . Despite the claimed number of impressions , these printers use up toner at an amazing rate - expect half the number of impressions claimed . I vowed to replace the original starter cartridges with ' hi-yield ' cartridges to try and eke out some savings . The printer requires cyan , yellow , magenta and black cartridges . I replaced the cyan , yellow and magenta cartridges at ( what I think of as ) colossal cost . Then it came time to replace the black . Got an error code " cartridge not supported " . After the usual annoying search on the Lexmark web site , I located a tech reference ( SO3600 ) that provided several steps ( including firmware upgrades ) as suggested steps . Needless to say , my printer fell into the " contact customer service " category . Customer service referred to its notes and informed me that the C532dn does not support the hi-yield black cartridge ( although it supports hi-yield cartridges for the other colors ) , that there was no fix , and I would have to return the opened cartridge to my distributer ( and good luck with that .. ) . This is Dilbertism to the max . There is absolutely no technical reason that the 532dn cannot support the black hi-yield cartridge when it fully supports other hi-yields . The more likely explanation is that the firmware printer routines that are intended to enforce cartridge ' no-refill ' and gray market , etc . policies were simply not correctly programmed and someone forgot to add the black hi-yield cartridge in the table of authorized cartridges . The stupid business model - ' cheap printer - insanely expensive toner ' - is basically anticonsumer . My advice : find a manufacturer that cares and stick with them . Lexmark is now on my list of banned suppliers .
  My PC connects to my wifi ( n ) network automatically every time I wake up or start my computer and the connection is solid . I can stream 1080p movies over the air from my other PC no problem . I recommend this .
  Especially at Christmas time , the labeler comes in very handy and these wider labels are especially good for card addressing , etc . Recommended .
  I am no where close to an audiophile , nor am I generally critical of a product . I purchased these , and took them back almost immediately - something I almost never do . While comfortable enough , the sound quality on these was worse than the $ 2 headphones that I picked up on the airplane . When others say the bass isn't punchy , what they mean is that there 's no bass whatsoever . The product marketing suggests that it amplifies sounds important to gaming such as bullets and footsteps . Indeed it does . It ALSO greatly amplifies static , compression artifacts , and crackling noises . Everything sounded tinny and cheap , as if the speakers were actually broken . Secondly , the microphone is of terrible quality . Every word you speak into it is nestled comfortably in a thick , squishy pad of hissing noise . This hiss , incidentally , is amplified by the headphones if you hear your own feed . The microphone far too quiet , requiring either an uncomfortably loud speaking voice or an increase in microphone gain . The gain , of course , equally increases voice volume and the background hiss . I exchanged these for an equivalently priced set from Sennhauser ( pc 166 ) . In comparison , the new set sounds like perfection . Additionally , the microphone adds little to no background noise and clearly picks up even a whisper . I can adjust my soundcard 's equalizer if I wish to blast high end .
  I purchased a pair of these cards back in July 2009 for my Sony PMW-EX1 , full-size HD Camera . I used them with an MxR Adapter and they worked wonderfully for recording hours upon hours of documentary footage . At the end April this year Digital SLR Cameras were becoming quite affordable and versatile . I purchased a Canon T2i and two more of the Transcend 16gb Class 6 cards . I was on my way to the Middle East to record a graduation and would eventually visit London . Using the Canon T2i indoors was fine , it would of course overheat if used constantly for over 40 minutes . I shot outside one day and let the camera rest every once and awhile . It was hot out . When I finally finished shooting my camera turned off by itself . I learned the memory card had fried . I returned back to the states and brought it to professional specialists who were unable to read the card , even through using a linux machine . I continued using my remaining cards to shoot , but began seeing overheating warnings after 30 minutes of shooting , mostly indoors . Today I was testing out my cards and one of them would report an error after recording 2 minutes on my Sony PMW-EX1 . I have a feeling these cards have low life-span and with the combination of heat and new technology , you may end up losing thousands of memories in a FLASH . Pun intended . I would recommend spending more to save your data and back up CONSTANTLY .
  Hi , this is my third bose sound system , the first being a lifestyle 8 system , a wave-radio and now this system . I bought this to replace my lifestyle 8 system , mostly on impulse for $ 1100 . I was also planning to upgrade my sorround sound for a while . As one of the previous reviewers , this is probably not the best value for money . Dont get me wrong , the sound is quite good , but I do not see a major improvement in the sound quality over my 6 yr old lifestyle 8 system . Overall , I am happy with my purchase . Just a note for one of the previous reviewers , the " boomy bass " can be decreased if you adjust it throuh the remote .. simply decrease the bass
  I have been using a mouse almost daily for the past 15 years or so , and I can honestly say that this is the best mouse I 've ever used . I 've been using a cheap Logitech one for the past few years , and I have had a couple small gripes about it that this mouse doesn't suffer from . i ) This mouse is pinpoint accurate . The cursor doesn't drift like it might with cheap mice . ii ) It also has very smooth tracking , so that the cursor never jumps around . Not having smooth tracking was a very annoying impediment with my last mouse which would bother me especially when I played first-person shooters . Although I have only been using this mouse for a day now , I am very impressed . A friend of mine owns one as well , and has been using it for about 5 years without a single issue . I can definitely recommend this product to anyone .
  These are the most comfortable , and fragile , headphones I 've ever owned . The design is unique . The sound is well above average , decent lows and mids , treble is a little muddy . It 's true what everyone says . The tension that keeps these headphones on your ears and off your neck comrs from a thin piece of clear , easily breakable plastic , so don't get them if you can't treat them carefully or have a big head . For me , they rest on a hook above the ground . The cable is relatively short , so they are better for mp3 players , music phones , headphone cable extenders , or bluetooth remote audio gateways ( which is what I use it mainly for ) . Definitely worth the $ 15 I paid for them .
  I have a Mac , and need a USB mouse . I wasn't paying attention when I purchased this , and was surprised to discover that it had a PS / 2 input . I shouldn't have been surprised , given that it 's clearly marked in the description - my mistake . I 'm writing this review in hopes of preventing others from making the same mistake . Otherwise , it seems to be a great mouse . If you have USB , you likely want this one instead : $U$ Logitech B100 Optical USB Mouse ]
  We bought this to replace an aging clock radio . It has .. some problems . You should buy something else . The biggest problem is this : if you change the alarm at even one minute after midnight on Sunday night / Monday morning , it will ring at the time you set - on Tuesday morning . On Monday morning the alarm doesn't ring at all . Apparently it always sets the alarm for tomorrow morning , which may mean as much as 35 hours and 59 minutes after you set it . We 've had to start setting a back-up alarm clock . Also , the " soothing white noise " features are anything but soothing . Honestly , getting a clock / radio / white noise machine all in one compact device was my primary reason for ordering this . I had visions of the steady , low crash of waves . Unfortunately , the designer had visions of screeching seagulls . All of the " nature sounds " are irritating after about ten seconds ( they repeat without variation every ten or so seconds ) , and much too loud . ( And if you turn the volume down , then it turns down the volume on the alarm , too . ) The only setting we ever use is the plain white noise . And you know what we eventually realized ? You can get that for free on any radio , just by tuning the dial to a spot where there 's no radio station broadcasting ! I recommend that you pick a different alarm clock - one that reliably sounds the alarm , for example - and that if you want a white noise machine , just turn on the radio and save yourself the expense and frustration of a specialized ( and specially annoying ) device .
  If you have the address it works great , but if you dont know the exact city that it is located then it seems next to impossible to find a location . While searching for a ski resort in new york i didnt know the city that it was located so i entered search nationwide setting from there the only places that showed up were aspen colorado and vail . Once i finally got the city name it showed right up . Overall works great if you have all of the info already but good luck trying to find something new and the poi database sucks if are not in a big city .
  I bought this from Amazon . com and got a USED / RETURNED unit . There were scrteched all over the screen and everything showed signs of used and wear . returned it the next day and guess what ? THEY CHARGED ME FOR SHIPPING . About the TV , the reception was okey . You need to walk around to find a spot for the best receptions . BOTTOM LINE , DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON . COM !
  I order this heart rate monitor for my forerunner 301 . It appeared to be brand new out of the packaging and I am sure it was , however , it does not work . It could be a dead battery , who knows , the bottom line is that it should have worked . Now I have this useless piece of equipment . I would buy a battery for it but I can't because I am in Afghanistan . The CR2032 battery required is not sold out here .
  Best 6x9 's EEVVEERR ! I have about 90 ( real RMS ) watts in each ( of 4 ) from a clean amp ( don't get a whimpy amp for these - it 'll be a waste - . 01 to . 07 THD and 100 to 105 SNR will do nicely ) and can't even imagine enduring much more ( though I do believe they could handle the 250 each with ease [ 200 to be safe , though ] ) - Can't hear my engine or even traffic with the windows OPEN ! Apparently quite efficient - VERY clean and tight . Instruments don't sound jumbled together and sound as they should . Sweet bass for 6x9 's , but you 'll still need a sub if you want to rattle your licence plate and set off alarms . QUALITY - the extremely low price is just another plus !
  The iAudio U2 is a nice mp3 player - but one of the big problems for me is the internal battery - it has to be recharged , you cannot just pop in another AA battery . And to make matters worse , the Product Description says that the AC Adapter / Charger is included ( COWON 's own website , the manufacturer , also says it is included ) - but it is NOT . Thus the only way to charge the U2 is with a USB connector , so plan on lugging your laptop with you to recharge your MP3 player . COWON tech / sales support says that " Includes " doesn't really mean include , it 's an optional item that must be purchased separately . And since Amazon doesn't carry , you 'll have to buy it from COWON directly ( ( .. ) ) . In trying to talk to COWON about this , I found out that you cannot , talk to them that is - they have no voice line for support - it 's all done by email or online chat ( when it works ) . Just another example of how servicing the customer has become a very low priority these days . My recommendation is to find another player that uses AA or AA batteries and buy some rechargeables . And if you have a problem with a COWON device , good luck getting someone to listen to you .
  I purchased the Sangean WR-1 radio for it 's AM feature . I enjoy listening to Talk Radio . I am well pleased with the radio 's total performance . The WR-1 has a great sound for it 's size . I would recommend the addition of an exterior AM antenna for distant radio stations .
  Sound is only okay-when it doesn't cut out . This seems to happen whenever the wearer breathes too deeply or turns his head at all . And they hurt ! My son wears glasses , so they hurt even worse . Msybe Sennheiser 's more pricey headphones are good , but no luck at all with anything under $ 50 . We returned these , kept on looking , and found super-comfortable , excellently crafted , beautifully designed , great-sounding headphones for just a little more-from Koss !
  My old Dell battery only held a charge for 20 minutes . This was a perfect replacement and now the laptop will run for over an hour . Exactly as described . Very satisfied .
  This camera is such a waste .. normal use even delicate use , will break this camera . I have had an older HP for years that Ive never had an issue with , but for some reason I have needed 2 replacements sent to me , due to internal software issues , the camera freezing , etc . It is way too touchy . Also their customer support is outsourced and I have a hard time getting the people to understand my problems , and they wont repair the camera , just keep sending new ones to me . This is a limited edition item , is it just supposed to sit pretty on the shelf ? I never know if they are going to send me the same model since its pretty hard to find now . A waste of time and money .
  I loved this camera . Other than small LCD , I liked everything on it . It would have been better if that battries were Li-Ion . Its pain to carry a separate battery pack or charger ..
  In 9 months , I have gone through 6 pairs of these headphones . They were a gift , so I could only exchange them . The sound is decent , but the build quality is awful . The problem has been the same on every pair - after a month or so , one ear phone would be barely audible while the other plays fine . Sony had better come up with a solution . A lot of people have had the same problems , and Sony won't own up to it and fix it . Since 1 pair hasn't lasted over 2 months , I would recommend staying away from these headphones until Sony corrects their issues .
  This is the 6th time I bought this product . bought 4 for my family , and bought 2 for my relative . such a great speaker system for the price .
  My card worked with XP by its support for it was scarce to say the least . Range is bad , and the prove is that Linksys has released a 2.5 version of this card with the new feature of ' extended range ' . Look somewhere else .
  Anyone who purchases a MR814 will encounter connection problems , but the main pain they will suffer is trying to communicate with the illiterate and unintelligable souls on the phones at Netgear 's tech-support center . And worst of all this company withholds relevant information from it 's customers until you scream load enough from your MR814 inflicted pain . Eventually they disclose that they are fully aware of your issues and have been , but hope to continue selling the MR814 even though it does not perform well in most applications . Warning : only purchase Netgear products where there is a clean and clear return policy that will " net " you your money back when you inevitably go looking for it !
  I managed to purchase these on sale for approx $ 87 AUD to replace a set of beats by dre studios I lost . In terms of music quality these are really something special within other IEMs of its price range . The bass is most definitely its strongest aspect where you literally feel the thump upon your ear drum with certain songs ( Doesnt sound too appetizing although it really is awesome ) . The mids and highs are a little muffled due to the overwhelming bass at times although this can easily be fixed by changing the eq on your player . I was contemplating the purchase of a fiio E6 amp to accompany these ( for bass purposes ) although it really isnt necessary unless you 're an extreme bass head . Their biggest downfall is comfort . After about 20 mins of listening it really does take a toll on your ears . In order to accomplish their full potential you really need to stick these in deep ( well i do , anyways ) . Considering the size of these it begins to hurt after a while to the point where i need to remove them to give my ears a breather . Hopefully after a while my ears become accustomed to them so I can enjoy their awesome quality all the time : DNote : An extensive period of time should be allowed to burn them in before you begin using them . So far its been 20 hours and they are already sounding better .
  I moved to this point and shoot camera from a Kodak and WOW ! It is one great little camera . I take it in my handbag everywhere that I go . Need a quick shot of something , no problem . The picture quality is great as well . The pictures are not grainy and are very clear . I have used it extensively since I got it in August and I am more than pleased . I take lots and lots of photos so it has been put to the test . My daughter liked it so much that she even asked for one as well to replace her 2 year old Kodak . Buy it ! It 's great !
  This works wonderfully ! Even driving through cities I still get great reception and the fact that it charges it a huge bonus considering the new ipods do not come with chargers .
  Product does what its supposed to BUT the picture is VERY deceptive . The form factor is 20x worse in real life . It doubles the bulk of the laptop and adds thickness only to the back of the laptop making the whole thing ugly and awkward . I returned mine the same day . If I wanted a VCR , I would buy a VCR .
  Microsoft did a great job with this webcam . Video quality is great and it works well in low lighting . My favorite thing of all is that the webcams design allows it to basically sit on any type of LCD monitor imagineable . I just switched from a 20 " to a 22 " and it fits no problem . Love it .
  These VHS tapes are garbage . On short play , ALL ( we bought 5 ) show distortion at the beginning of the tape . On long play they are completely unwatchable . If you are thinking it might be the VCR , think again , we have an older tape that looks perfect in short AND long play . I found better tapes at the $ 1 store back when you could find VHS tapes at the $ 1 store . Save your money .
  I have to agree with many of the other reviews I have seen . I would give the product ( and company ) zero stars if that was an option . The TV picture is OK , but the DVD player is almost useless . mine will not even identify that a disc is in it now . I did know that my unit was out of warranty when it brokedown . But I had emailed the company for some troubleshooting suggestions on how to overcome the difficulties with the DVD . They would not even reply to the email . So I will quickly be replacing this TV / DVD with a brand that works and will never buy an Apex product again .
  I would not recommend this printer . Print quality is poor and the ink cartridges are expensive .
  I plug in to a couple lower-end Bose computer speakers . I have serious hearing loss at 61 years old . For the first time in years I can listen to music and enjoy full sound . I can watch a movie and not bother my living partner with the excessive volume . I can't imagine how these must work for a normal hearing person , I love them ..
  This is a great purchase to match the DSC-T30 Camera . It screws in the tripod mount , looks great and protects the camera well .
  This cool looking alarm does exactly what I want an alarm to do . I can go to sleep listening to a CD or radio and wake to CD , radio or alarm . I haven't tried the MP3 connection yet but that offers me another option . I live in a " fringe " FM signal area and the included wire antenna brings a reception as good as any other I 've tried . Sound quality is better then most FM / AM radio alarms I 've used . I like the option of falling asleep using one sound source and waken by another source . Two different alarm settings is a very useful feature . Three levels of lighting are available , the brightest will light up a room ! The back light alone is more light then I want . It would be nice if that could be lowered or turned off . After much searching , this alarm is the best I have investigated , with the most useful features .
  Hi i bought this webcam in brandsmart it cost me $ 20 when i got home i tried it everything was green so i thought of resarting my computer then i tried it again but nothing everything always came out black so plz dont waste $ 20 or $ 30 dollars on this !
  This is a must for anyone who travels . Simply set up the shot , walk in it and push the button . Now you can be in all those vacation shots instead of behind the camera . The direction remote only works from the front of camera and does have a limited range , approx . 20 ' . Mine came with a nice little pouch that slid onto the camera strap , so it stay with camera at all times and is easily accessible .
  This product arrived promptly but turned out to be defective . Files were successfully transferred onto the flash drive , but after ejecting the flash drive and reopening it , some of the files were gone or unreadable . I emailed Kingston support and was told the flash drive was defective .
  When used to bounce flash from a ceiling , this product does work . However , when I use it as a direct flash ( 90 degree angle ) it produces shadows and a dark output . I don't know why . I would assume it would diffuse the light and produce even tones .
  the item 95101 I purchase for burning pictures on to the discs worked very well and would buy this item again
  Not as spected , for the almost $ 100.00 , NO a good purchase . Bad in the high frequencies . I did not get a crispy sound . My cellphone ( Sony Ericson ) that I got for FREE came with a better sound headphones . 30 will be a good price . I do not recommend these headphonesThanks
  I have owned this machine for only two weeks , and consumer DVD recorders have a distressing tendency to fall apart after a month or so , so what I say must be taken with a grain of salt . So far , so good . This machine offers excellent image quality and is notably more tolerant of different brands of discs than some other recorders I 've owned . Far fewer " disc error " or " can't read disc " messages than my Philips or my Go-Video . Although this machine bridges the format gap by recording on DVD + RW ( not + R ) discs as well as DVD-R / RW discs , it does not afford the full functionality of a DVD + RW recorder . Most notably , one cannot do " thumbnail " picture icons for chapters , and I was also unable to add them using a + RW recorder to a disc first recorded on this machine ( perhaps this could be done with a computer ) . Also , the editing capabilities of this machine , which are formidable , do not apply in + RW mode . So this is not truly a " dual " machine . Another minor note : the " one-touch " dubbing function , which operates via the firewire connection , does not work unless the tape being dubbed was digital to begin with . Thus it does not work if you 're using a Digital 8 camcorder outputting a digitized signal from an older analog tape . But these images can be recorded in the " normal " way just fine . All in all , I 'm very pleased , so far . Hint : check out the " used and new " merchants before you pay amazon 's price .
  I have had the Coolpix 5700 since July 2002 , and I am delighted with the photos I have taken and the compliments I have received on them . I have taken some stunning photos and printed them onto 8 x 10 photo paper with incredible results . I 've even blown up tiny portions of pictures without any pixels becoming visible when printed ! The Coolpix has a number of features that make it a great camera , but it also has some drawbacks . The 5700 has several different user modes that can be preprogrammed for different situations . The auto modes are well-programmed if you don't want to set these items manually . The auto-focus has several different settings ( i.e. spot , matrix ) and a manual override that comes in handy for photographing minute items such as spider webs that are too thin for the autofocus to " see . " The 8X optical zoom is great for setting up shots without having to move . The biggest drawback I have found with the 5700 is that it is useless for digiscoping . I have a Swarovski spotting scope through which I want to take pictures ( bird watching , etc . ) , but because of the size of the lens on the 5700 , my pictures have severe vignetting . If you want a great camera for digiscoping , I recommend the 4500 . Another disappointment is that the 5700 does not have the panorama assist feature that the 4500 has . Overall , the picture quality and settings for the 5700 are great , but it has a couple of drawbacks depending on what you want to do with the camera .
  I bought this to replace a venerable Apple LaserWriter in hopes that I would get good quality printing , faxing , scanning , and perhaps some OCR . It does some of these things OK , and others not at all , despite the promises . Photocopies come out OK - as long as you don't require much subtllty in shadings , and as long as you 're not trying to copy originals with light colors . It does fax OK , although sometimes it 's hard to figure out if a fax went through OK . I mostly fax from my desktop , and only occasionally from hard copy . When I fax from my desktop , I have to turn this machine off , or else it intercepts my OUTGOING fax as if it were an INCOMING fax , even though I 've firmly instructed it not to answer incoming faxes . As for printing , it does an OK job , but it 's neither a TrueType nor a PostScript machine . It is , instead , an emulator , and sometimes you get something close to what you want , and sometimes you get something that looks suspiciously like Courier . Scanning is very hit-or-miss . Sometimes you get an acceptable scan , sometimes the scan doesn't come out worth a damn , and sometimes the software just balks at doing anything and says " There 's a problem . Please restart your machine . " Since this fixes nothing , you wind up swearing at the machine instead of getting any work done . OCR is a complete waste of time . To put it bluntly , the software for Macs that is bundled with the machine isn't even an honest attempt , and it seems clear that Brother really doesn't care because it 's so clunky , and incompetent . I suspect that they just bought any old piece of software that had " Mac " and " OCR " in the product description , purely so they could say they had it . Don't even think of trying to use it . I will continue to use this machine for a while for copying , faxing , and printing , but it 's a compromise machine that does nothing very well . Not Recommended .
  This review is aimed at an advanced user who will want to use this as a desktop replacement for serious work , or serious gaming for that matter . My decision to purchase this model was largely swayed by the screen . A 17 " widescreen display running at a resolution of 1680 by 1050 is something to behold . This is definitely the best screen I have seen yet , and completely kicks my old 1600 by 1280 CRT monitor . There is just no comparison . Four weeks later , and I still say " wow " each time I power up the beast . The display is well backed up by the Nvidia GeForce FX 5700 card with 128 megs DDR . For pure gaming , I am constantly blown away by Half-Life 2 running at the full 1680 * 1050 at highest quality settings . Gameplay is smooth and the display crisp , however in large and busy scenes one can notice a slight lag in response . For this reason , it would have been nice if they had put in 256 megs on the card , as seems to be the standard these days . Note that this is a desktop-equivalent graphics card , and so all the top PC games should run just fine . The 1 gig of RAM and the 3.2 GHz processor pair up to provide quick and smooth work under Windows XP . Firing up MSOffice or compiling reams of code is appropriately fast , and I am more than happy with the performance of the unit . Before I forget , the Harman Kardon speakers are very impressive . The sound compares very well with a pair of quality bookshelf speakers and is definitely the best stuff that I have heard coming out of a laptop . Of course , they cannot compare with a pair of good hi-fi speakers . All the standard plugs and ports aside , the digital media memory card reader is a welcome addition , as are the four networking possibilities in the built in modem , network , wireless and firewire units . Bluetooth is missing .. a pity , but the unit does provide IrDA , so I can use that to talk to my mobile phone . A disappointment is the DVD + RW drive . You can tear through a hundred websites and manuals but nowhere does it say what speeds this unit operates at . Finally , I queried this directly with HP to be told that for DVD + RW the unit rewrites at 2x speed . This is old technology , and I am a little upset that this unit does not match the level of the rest of the machine , and they disguise this fact as best as possible . A serious user of DVD + RW might therefore have to fork out for a new unit that can handle 8x . The unit is manufactured by Sony , so of course it purposefully does not do DVD-RW and DVD-R , only + R and + RW . There are also no region free patches it seems , so one has to use a software solution to be able to watch films from other parts of the world . The writing software that comes with the unit is meant for amateur users . One really has to purchase Nero to get decent use from this DVD + RW writer . The other BIG disappointment is the TV tuner accessory . It is preset in hardware to match the standard USA channels , NTSC only . So , the instant you leave the US border , you might as well throw the unit away . The increase in cost should they have included a fully tunable NTSC / PAL unit would have been minor , and so this is really inexcusable . This is a laptop , it is meant to travel . There are other TV tuners that provide this functionality that are compatible with WinXP Media Center edition , and I intend to get one soon . Software-wise , the machine comes with loads of marketing garbage preinstalled - lots of trial versions , lots of things asking for money , for upgrades , for serial numbers . The solution to this is of course a complete format , and reinstallation of the OS , drivers , and a few useful applications . Follow this by updating windows online with service pack 2 , and then by downloading available driver updates from the HP site . Then install the free AVG anti-virus program , Nero DVD burning software , MSOffice and you 're pretty much done . As for Linux users , this laptop is a lot " closer " to a desktop machine than other laptops I feel , so one should be able to get Linux up and running with few problems , and maybe even have most of the integrated peripherals working too . I do however have my doubts about Linux support for the integrated memory card reader . You should check this beforehand if it is important to you . In summary , the ADVANTAGES are : - fantastic screen and sound , and a great graphics card - fast machine with loads of memory - has all the necessary plugs and slots and features - HP support , great website with all updates , etcthe DISADVANTAGES are : - a useless TV tuner unless you will ever only be in the USA - old technology DVD + RW writer - heavy with a short battery life ( 2 hours max ) , but then again this is a desktop replacement , don't forget thatSo , a five star rating , less one for the dud TV tuner and slow DVD + RW writer . Overall , I am thrilled with my purchase , and will be even more so when I get an international TV tuner .
  muy buenos discos apropiados para las grabadoras de cd lo unico es que los dos lados es igual y aveces cuesta identificar el lado donde graba
  The only decent thing about this mic is that it looks alright and is easy to use . However , I usually had to keep the mic directly next to my mouth in order to be heard and the quality wasn't that great . The base of it is also very light so it moves around easily and often tips over . I 'd highly suggest the Logitech USB Desktop Mic , which I 've also used , and is much better for less than $ 10 more .
  It 's cheap and the cheapness shows . I was quite disapoointed with the quality of the ink . Will not buy it again .
  I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot . I had such a card for more than a year . In that period , I used it in my camera . It 's filled up for several times . Also occationally I use a card reader ( SimpleTech ) to write / read that card , to transfer some big files between computers . It 's all fine , and suddenly one day , when the card was half full , and after a card reader reading , I got " CF card error " on my camera . Fortunately , after I delete a few pictures , I could move on . I gave the card to other people , so I don't know how it 's doing now . After that , I purchased another Viking 512MB , half year ago . I used it to transfer files for a few times , and have never filled it up using my camera yet . Now I am getting consistent " CF card error " message on my camera , even after re-format for several times , while I don't have that problem if I use another card . One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card . I can not verify though . Anyway , I will have to buy another card now , and it won't be viking for this time . = One month later = I contacted with their customer support . They gave me a number for return , and I mailed back my damaged CF card . They sent back a new one in a week . The new one is working fine so far . The exchange was not difficult . They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt . They only verified the serial number . That 's good .
  Only rated 1 star because -5 is not an option ! Received these for Christmas - absolutely disappointed . These are headphones that a Dollar Store should be ashamed to sell . I have owned ( and also sold ) Sennheiser products for the last 30 years and been completely satisfied - which makes these pieces of crap even more disturbing . Also disturbing is the fact these are made in China for most likely less than $ 3 , and sold for well over $ 100 trading on the Sennheiser reputation . Following are observations : The manual - nothing on the base / transmitter / charger works as described - probably a bad English translation from a Chinese writer who never even saw the headphones . Also featured - NO CONTACT INFO of any kind - no support number , but then again , if I sold crap like this for so much , I wouldn't want to talk to customers either ! Design - no stereo balance adjustment , no manual tuning adjustment , cheap on / off switch - feels like it 'll break tomorrow .. insufficient volume control ; non-breathable ear cuffs - be prepared to sweat under there ! Sound Quality - NONE - will not function without the " surround " feature on ( why even have a switch ? ) - you can't provide enough signal to drive it with a computer sound card , powered speakers , or component stereo system .. and with ' surround ' on the bass is extremely exaggerated ( sounds like one of those mini cars with the 5000 watt stereo and subwoofer with the windows rolled up and 20 feet away from you at a traffic light ) . This combines with a S / N ratio of what must be 2 and cutting out of one or both earpieces , ( and an annoying ' whoosh whoosh whoosh ' as you move or turn your head .. RANGE : extremely limited - less than 10 feet without even more cutting out and noise ( as a matter of fact , cutting out LESS THAN 4 FEET from the transmitter ( directly under it , down 1 floor ) . With this kind of range , what 's the point of wireless ? 15 years ago I owned a pair of $ 60 Recotons ( no longer available ) that were better designed ( receiver allowed ANY headphones to be plugged in , 100 ft + range , and NO signal quality problems , with sufficient volume range ) that outperformed this by 10,000 to 1 . I 've seen the other reviews , and I realize there must be something awfully wrong with this particular set , but with no contact info how do I proceed to fix it ? And how will you ? Are you willing to chance spending over $ 100 and get something THAT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL ? And what , send it back for exchange and get another piece of junk ? I will certainly pursue satisfaction for this outrageous ripoff . And if I get it , I 'll change the review , but for now it stands on my experience with the product . Recommendation : don't even consider buying this crap .
  I bought the printer with this cartridge and it never printed in black ink , only color . Apparently the ink cartridge is defective . I have to buy the entire cartridge including the ink tanks to correct the problem , but the ink tanks themselves are fine . I am unsure about the durability of the product since I have only printed maybe 10 pages until it stopped working completely . And I am a little afraid to buy another and experience the same problem again . I don't suggest buying it .
  Excellent sound quality . My grandson loved the first Grado 60 so much I gave it to him and bought a second .
  I am highly disappointed with this device . It has a very annoying soft-power off if I don't interact with it for about 15 minutes . This power-saving feature is understandable and I can basically deal with it by a left click . But it gets worse from here . Sometimes the above procedure fails . You need to completely power-down ( remove battery cover ) and reset . For the past week or so it required that I comletely redo the bluetooth pairing / discovery process . Today it is impossible to detect the device . In less than a month , this mouse has completely failed . I 'm returing it to where I got it . Based on other reviews I 've read , I 'm not the only person experiencing these types of problems . I 'm not even interested in a replacement . I 'll get a competing brand .
  Totally dissapointed . I bought this item as a result of the previous reviews shown here , and what a dissapointment it really is . The image quality is absolutely terrible . The screen flickers , has a verry narrow field of view .. meaning , you have to be looking at it head on in order to see anything at all . I wouldn't purchase this item , and I don't recommend you do !
  I compared many 32 LCD TV 's and the Panasonic LX600 has the best picture quality . I compared LG , Sharp , and Samsung and the Panasonic has the best color and angle viewing . It 's a little more expensive than some other 32 inch models but for the price you get a better product . Only disapointment is that Panasonic doesn't offer a 37 in model . This unit has 3000:1 contrast ratio , 8ms refresh , and 500 brightness . The stand allows for the tv to be moved side to side which is a nice feature . The speakers are on the bottom so the tv fits in tight place where some 32 lcds have the speakers on the side which increases the size of the tv . If there is any complaint , its that the remote feel cheap . Not bad , but just kind of inexpensive . Overall , I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 32inch LCD .
  I bought this tripod with the intention of using it for both still photography and video . Its head is truly fluid moving , unlike many other tripods on the market . However , the pluses end there . The construction is rather flimsy , and is not best suited for outdoor conditions . Do not use this tripod for still photographs ; one cannot rotate the head vertically , extremely limiting is usefulness . As a matter of fact , after about a month of ownership , one of the rubber pegs on the leg fell off , and now it does not attach on securely . Not only that though , is that the grip that allows you to move the head fell off , rendering the tripod useless . For $ 85 there are many more higher quality tripods that I would have bought . This tripod in reality is worth about $ 35 . I will return this product , expect a refund , and go visit a real camera store to actually try out the tripod before purchasing online .
  I bought my headphones over 15 years ago . At the time , I purchased them based solely on the fact that they were the most comfortable pair on the rack . Flash forward 15 years and they 're still the most comfortable pair of headphones I 've ever worn . I 'm no audiophile , so I can't comment in-depth on the sound reproduction . Suffice to say they 've always sounded awesome to me . So after 15 years of moderate-to-heavy use , I can say the following : - They are as comfortable as they day I bought them ( the most comfortable I 've ever worn ) . - They sound as good as the day I bought them ( the best-sounding I 've ever tried ) . - The cord and connections are as solid as the day I bought them . Yes , they were relatively pricey , however , I think they 've more than made up for that in longevity . Not to mention awesomeness . A couple very minor complaints : - The cord is very long . Usually this is an advantage , but it can be a little bit of a hassle sometimes . - The material covering the padding on the ear cups is definitely showing its age . It 's flaking quite badly and the inside edge has come unfastened , exposing the foam rubber .
  Solid performance for everyday use going on a couple of years now . I buy original because often buying the cheaper stuff comes back to burn you .
  The cartridges are expensive and run out very quickly . Changing cartridges requires a study of multiple lights - is one flashing or not ? The paper loader is finicky . It finally jammed in a way that it could not be fixed and , if it could , it would not be worth the cost of the repair . Best news is that my retailer exchanged the now-useless cartridges , of which I had to keep four in stock . No wonder this model has been discontinued . To those who own one , per the science officer in ' Alien ' : " You have my sympathies . "
  I couldn't believe that I actually decided to purchase these for an upcoming long plane flight for my almost 2yr old daughter . I thought to myself that this will just be a gigantic waste of money because no matter how well they are supposed to fit a toddler there was no way she was going to keep these on and would probably break them inside of 15 mins . WOW was I wrong ! I could not believe what I was seeing . We tried them out at home the day they arrived and she sat and watched an entire movie without taking them off and she actually fought to keep them on all day . I couldn't believe it . The volume limiter is also a great idea since every toddler knows how to operate every single button on all electronics . I also have a 11 month old that when she saw her big sister wearing these of course she had to also and even though they are not designed for a child that small they stayed on pretty well . Of course she could not sit still too long . Bottom line I don't believe you could be disappointed with this purchase . They are inexpensive and they work . Of course on a plane trip with 2 kids even if they work for 10mins your happy .
  2 of the 4 rechargeable batteries doesnt works at all . They are suppossed to be new and they dont work ! I would spend 5 dollars more buying a Sony Charger . But i will never buy TechB , its terrible . I Hope Amazon takes the advice of no sell such bad things .
  I think maybe I 'm having a bad experience with WRT54GS because I 'm using both XP and OS X. Every other day , the router stop responding , then I can't even connect to the router until I reset it . I upgraded the firmware to the latest , 1.50.9 released 10/1/06 . It worked fine for a couple of weeks , then my mac mini couldn't get any DHCP assigned , even it was connected with Ethernet . This is a known problem , but Linksys hasn't been updated their firmware , and the user can't download older version of firmware from their site . I didn't see Apple OS X as one of supported OS , so I guess it 's not a Linksys ' fault . But if you 're using an OS X , you should avoid this router .
  Picked this keyboard up after I saw it used in an HTPC for less than $ 1,000 article on Engadget to give it a whirl at home . Pros-Cost-Decent trackball accuracy-Comfortable to use whether sitting on your lap , or held in mid-air just navigating . Cons-World 's cheapest quality keyboard . The keys feel horrible . In contrast to the sturdy frame construction , the pretty good trackball , and the mouse / media keys , the actual keyboard is HORRIFIC . - Sleep mode . Sometimes the keyboard goes into sleep mode and there 's no visual indication of this except for the lack of on-screen response . I found that rolling the trackball a few times then hitting the left mouse button brings it out of sleep better than any other method . Which admittedly makes absolutely no sense , but IT WORKS ! - Have to keep a spare wired keyboard around because with this keyboard you can't access BIOS settings or force the PC to boot from CD / DVD instead of HDD . - Misses keystrokes . This is probably due to the crappy keyboard quality , but if you type reasonably fast this thing misses letters all over the place . Good enough for a quick IM , but don't write an e-mail to your boss . Other thoughts .. Despite the keyboard quality , I would recommend this keyboard to others who are looking for something simple yet effective . Just don't try putting the adapter anywhere other than line-of-sight maybe fifteen feet . My PC sits behind a smoked glass door with the rest of the home entertainment gear , otherwise this thing would stick out like a unicorn horn .
  It 's nice to have the appropriate lens hood for what is a relatively expensive lens , unfortunately Canon take advantage of this desire and exploit their loyal customers with over priced bits of black plastic , this is one of those bits of black plastic that you will want but should never have to feel so ripped off when obtaining it . It fits very well , looks good , has a nice furry inner surface , but I suspect that it 's shallow profile means that it will afford little if any benefit to the performance of the lens .
  The JVC DF420AU D-VHS tape does exactly what it proposes : given a properly set up D-VHS VCR , it makes perfect pixel by pixel copies of HDTV . I cannot see any difference between live and recorded high definition TV when I use these and a firewire connection with my HM-DH40000 . You can also tape SVHS or VHS formats on this tape , and those formats come out quite nicely as well . However , the quiet secret here is that the formulation here is essentially identical to high quality S-VHS tape - at 4 times the price . The only difference is that rather than having a single hole in the chassis this tape has a second , allowing the VCR to read it as a D-VHS tape rather than a S-VHS tape . There is an obvious workaround to this that can be found fairly easily on the web ; search if you 're interested . From my experience S-VHS tapes with the workaround work just as well as this far more expensive tape , which is why I knock off two stars , and a third for a price gouging at 1.5 times the already outrageously expensive 150 minute D-VHS DF300AU . I can't guarantee S-VHS tapes will last as long , but then again , since there 's no warranty on the D-VHS tapes either there doesn't seem to be much risk . I also haven't been able to tell any difference between the JVC and Maxwell DVHS versions , which is unsurprising . Data recording - which is all D-VHS really is - either records data or it doesn't . Cheaper tapes definitely will have drop outs , but quality tapes won't . One further note . There are still a few 3 hour SVHS tapes available at half the cost of this from dealers , which would be my recommendation if you need to archive long sagas like the LOTR movies , Saving Private Ryan , or the Deer Hunter when they show up on premium cable HDTV . Short of archiving sports directly from a tuner instead of a PVR , there 's not much that can't fit on a 3 hour tape instead of the much more expensive 3.5 hour version sold here .
  Easy set up and great connection . Do keep in mind that your speed is greatly diminished ( about 40 % slower ) if you don't have USB 2.0 . Otherwise , it 's a great , stable device . Also , D-Link has a website with excellent support documentation . And if that 's not enough , they also offer free tech support over the phone .
  This fragile little camera is not built to last . After 9 months of light use , the plastic latches on the interior of the battery compartment door broke . Sony refused to honor warranty and wanted $ 175 to fix it . This problem is so common that ebay has auctions for kits to fix the problem at about $ 40 , but the repair is fairly complex to do at home . The camera is not robust enough even for moderate use . Sony customer service is a joke . If you must buy one , unbroken DSC-W1 's commonly sell on ebay for about $ 30 .
  I 'll admit that I purchased the Swingyde based on the reviews i read . Bad mistake . I play golf at least once a week . In my opinion this is priced 25 bucks too much . It mainly helps you hinge your wrist on the back swing and nothing else . There is SOO much more to a golf swing than hinging your wrist ! My opinion - pass on this product and get some lessons - preferably an instructor that records your swing and analyzes it with you one on one afterwards .
  these headphones were great at first , but then failed ( right ear stopped working ) after 3 months . I sent the orginal pair back to the manufacturer for a replacement , but the replacement pair also failed with the same problem after a couple more months . Stay away from these .
  Not good for running . It moves constantly in your ear . I wish it was a bit more snug . I guess you get what you pay for .
  J. schaulis 's review is fantastic . I wish he had commented on legal size copying and scanning . The most important things to copy adn scan in home are some legal papers . I find most Canon AIOs can handle legal paper , but they can not actually copy of scan legal documents ( not sure about printing ) , they can only copy or scan up to 11.7 " . If you want copy or scan true 14 " long legal paper , you have to use HP AIO.I hate legal size paper , but what can I do ? This is the USA , we use " legal paper " and stick to " inches " !
  im very happy with this seller this is the second time i have ordered from cameta camera and ive have been very happy with the speed of the shipping and delivery the products are as described and are all brand new as stated i will recomend this place to all web buyers and i actually called and placed my order and the people i spoke to was very friendly and they knew what they were doing great place to buy from
  This battery 2mm longer and 2mm wider then original , doesn't fit slot in the telephone .
  this is a good product . It easily picked up the local TV stations ' signal . I can't say it is the best product but for the price I paid , I am happy with it .
  I ordered the this item and what I received was a different cheaper model . I will never order from Fog Dog again and am considering the same for AMAZON . I contacted FOG Dog and have returned the scanner . I was told I would recieive a full purchase refund plus the cost of the retunn shipping . Within an hour I received an email indicating there would be no refund for the return shipping cost . I am still wainting for the refund for the purchase price of the SC230 scanner I ordered but was not delivered . BEWARE ! Uniden SC230 Scanner featuring Pre-Programmed NASCAR / Busch Frequencies
  After reading all of these reviews and getting really excited before and after my purchase of these earbuds , I was sure I 'd found the best pair of earphones I 'd ever own . I certainly paid enough for them . They make headsets for famous performers .. and almost every reviewer gives them 5 stars ! What more could a music lover want ? However , I am disappointed . And I really hate that I am . My earbuds arrived yesterday , and after over an hour of meticulous experimentation with all of the included ear pieces , and finding the best seal possible , the sound was not acceptable for this price range of headset . I could be accused of just not finding the proper seal at this point , but I manually pushed and held them in my ears to determine the ultimate listening experience if they were as snug and secure as possible . They just sounded too empty , very far from " rich " .. like something was missing . They were quite clear , but the bass was lacking . And I specifically got the 5 's instead of the 3 's because of the reviews that said the bass was perfect in this next step up the price ladder . I 've never considered myself a " basshead " or even an audiophile , but the full , enriched audio experience which these reviews and the product manufacturers promised was not what I got . My V-MODA Bass Freq earbuds were better ( until they shorted out ) . I listened to Bjork while testing and my Phillips headphones that came with a cd player from 5 years ago that I stored as a lackluster backup were better ( but they 're almost fully shorted out too ) . The sound fullness just isn't there . As soon as we jumped in my boyfriend 's Infiniti and listened to the same music on his Bose speakers on the way to Taco Bell , I knew that I hadn't just been hallucinating . I kept trying to convince myself that they were awesome , and that I must not be listening correctly somehow . But I think they just aren't that great . A few other reviewers have pointed this out too . Perhaps I should have gotten the Extended Bass model .. ? At any rate , I just took them to the post office to get a refund .
  The 7 " LCD Portable display was not worth the money I spent to own it . First the battery would not hold enough charge to be considered portable . When the device was plugged in the picture would become distorted if you did not charge before hand . After one and a half months of having .. " not usage time " .. the sound would not work correctly nthen the picture started to fade out . Shortly after that the AC / DC ( wall plug in ) would not give the device enough power to even staqrt a movie . Unless you can personally verify the circuit level quality of this item your self , then do nto buy this .
  The glass cutter works as it should , although I have a problem with one corner of the glass not always being squared . It may just be that , by the time I get the cutter pulled back in close to me , it 's not getting the same downward pressure . It 's handy , though , for cutting glass for picture frames .
  I just got a Dell Pocket DJ for Christmas and I got a car kit to go with it . Well the transmitter that came with the kit was the Belkin one . Well that thing is a piece of crap . It worked once and than it didn't . Plus I didn't like the automatic on / off . It took like 20 minutes for the damn thing to turn on . So I went to Radio Shack and talked to the sales person . He showed me the Monster FM Transmitter and I was like " Ok , I 'll give it a try " My car is a 2004 so it doesn't have a tape player , so I have to use a FM Transmitter . Anyway , I love this thing . It is practically crystal clear and I only had to change the station once during a 45 minute ride which doesn't bother me because I realize these things aren't meant to be perfect . I just wanted to be able to hear my music and I can with good sound quality and it is easy to use . I would definetly reccomend it .
  I ordered this product specifically because it is non-SDHC for my Wii . Tiger Direct sent a SDHC version . I called customer service and , since I was persistent in complaining about having to pay for return shipping and the proximity of Christmas , the rep . claimed he would refund my credit card . I guess you could call getting a free card a plus , but I think everyone should be warned you won't get what you want . The rep said they have no regular , old SD cards anymore .
  I bought this MP3 player as a xmas gift for my sister after comparing characteristics and price vs other brands . It worked for 3 days and then just died . We have tried all the troubleshooting we can think of / have been suggested and nothing has workedI 'm trying to get a replacement or a refund from sandiskThis failure adds to all the ones I 've had with flashdrives ( 512 kb and 2 GB ) I WON'T BUY ANOTHER SANDISK PRODUCT EVER ! Save yourselves all the trouble and frustration and look for other brands .
  I love it and use it all the time ! It 's one of my most useful tools . It always works and works well . I recommend it , highly , to anyone .
  This company is very bad with rebate . Please send certified mail if you want to get your rebate . They are good at claiming not receiving your rebate . When you write to them , they don't response and don't bother to call them . Your call will be forwarded to their fulfillment center . I did file a complain against this company to BB and got a letter saying that the company did not response to their request . Last year , I bought this router with a rebate . Mailed in all the requested documentations ( receipt , original upc , form ) , but not by certified mail . Six months later , checked the status ( wheresmyrebate . com ) and said they need the original upc . Called them up and was told to resubmit a copy of the rebate . I did that , and 3 wks later , check the status again . Still said the same thing . Anyways , the whole process drags on and on . I called them up and was told the offer was closed . Anyone out there have this problem with Netgear rebate ? I don't know now . Maybe I should return it to Amazon for a credit .. Help .. Thanks
  I think the product name is pretty applicable . Simple ( Tech ) is right ! Just plug in the cf card and plug into a PC card slot and it works . No drivers necessary ( under XP ) . Very inexpensive , too !
  When they work , they work fine . Successful burns of video files and home movies play well on my stand-alone DVD player , which is what I wanted these blank DVD + R discs for . But approximately half of them fail to write the lead-out , leaving them unusable . All of a sudden the great deal when buying in bulk isn't such a great deal when you 're throwing half of them in the trash . I won't make the mistake of buying this brand again just because of a lower price . I haven't used a lot of brands , but I have had much better success with Verbatim DVD-R discs .
  Hi , I have had the VDR-D300 for about 6 months now . I have never gotten a recording session to last more than about 20 min . The camcorder constantly locks up , usually after about 10 min . This is on a full battery - the unit never gets even to a battery alarm . Several times the reset button nor the reset proceedure per the manual works . I must have a faulty unit . I 'm investigating repair . The unit has a great lens , camera , and video image , but my unit is not stable at all .
  I like the tunebuds . It 's a good concept - earbuds and lanyard , all in one . Fits good , sounds good , and looks good , especially when I 'm out for a run or working out . My wife doesn't know it yet but I 'm buying another set for her .
  I bought these earphones 10 months ago and loved them until this week . The sound quality is great , and they 're very comfortable , but they WILL disintegrate . The rubber on the cord has come off in two places , leaving the wires completely exposed . My right earbud has also begun to periodically stop working . Sometimes it 's fine , and other times I don't get any sound at all . It 's clearly dying a slow death and I expect it to stop working entirely eventually . For the price , you probably won't find a better sounding pair of earphones . If you 're looking for a pair that will actually hold up , however , look elsewhere . I 've got to buy a replacement pair of earbuds now to replace my broken Fontopias , and I definitely won't be buying these again .
  It seems to me that all headphones die within 1 year , so why get expensive ones . I have gone through about 5 pairs of these so far , they last me on average 6 months before one ear bud loses function . To me , these are the best value I could find .
  My wife and I bought ourselves a CellSocket for a Holiday Gift . It 's enabled us to unplug Ma Bell and lower our phone bill in half by using those airtime minutes and low-cost long distance calls from the phones in the house . The unit works with my T-Mobile ( used to be VoiceStream ) Nokia 6190 ( and quite a few other handsets ) . The CellSocket sits on your desk and your PCS phone drops into its cradle when you come home . The CellSocket recharges the PCS phone . After unplugging Ma Bell , you plug it in a phone outlet next to the desk . You can use a " tee " to then plug-in your desk phone into the same phone outlet . When there is an incoming call on your PCS phone , the phones in your house ring and callerID displays just like it did with Ma Bell . When you pick up , the sound is as good as your PCS phone . If you are in a good location , it sounds just as good as your wired phone . If you are in a poor coverage area , buy the one with an external antenna jack . You can buy gain antennas to improve reception . To dial , you pick up any phone in the house and hear a special dialtone . Then you dial numbers just like you would on your PCS phone . The # key acts like the Send or Talk key . The CellSocket works just fine with banking applications or voice mail where you need touch tones to navigate around menus . The # key works normally during a phone call . Kids have to be taught this extra step so they can call 911 # if they have to . CellSocket gives my wife one number where she can be reached at home , shopping or on the road . The PCS cell provider 's voicemail catches calls when I am on the phone or not able to answer it . An answering machine can only catch calls when you are not on the phone . It 's really great for providing phone service into areas where you can't get phone service , need it for an emergency line , or simply want to unplug Ma Bell to save some money . The only shortcomings of this product are 1 ) Having to remember to dial # after the number . I find the special dial tone reminds me to dial using the PCS dialing method . 2 ) The Call Waiting feature does not work with CellSocket ( or I did not figure it out yet ) . We don't use it anyway since we don't like being interrupted during a call and know calls are being caught by voicemail . 3 ) When the power fails , and you have an incoming call , only the PCS phone rings . The other phones don't have dialtone . To overcome this , you can plug the charger into a uninteruptable power supply ( UPS ) - the same kind used to keep computers running during a power failure . 4 ) It does not work with computer modems or fax machines . I use a wireless computer connection and an online service like e-fax that converts an incoming fax into an e-mail attachment . Despite these few shortcomings , I like the product very much and highly recommend it . Its savings , particularly on long distance bills and the recurring monthly bills make it very useful for nearly anyone .
  I have just returned the Monster IEE cable [ .. ] after comparing it side by side with an inexpensive [ .. ] cable . It is all marketing hype as far as IEE link is concerned . { The less expensive } cable worked as good as the Monster Low Noise , Gas injected etc . cable . So do yourself a favor save some money .
  I SOMETIMES USE MY BLU RAY PLAYER OUTSIDE WITH MY PROJECTOR , AND NEEDED AN EXTRA POWER CORD SO I DON'T HAVE TO FISH IT IN AND OUT OF MY ENTERTAINMENT CENTER . KIND OF LIGHT DUTY BUT FITS MY NEEDS ..
  The hood actually made it more difficult to see the LCD . It was much more effective to just turn so the LCD was in my own shadow . The rubber eye-cup fell off frequently . Eventually , after falling off three times over the course of one hour , I lost in it some tall grass .
  Worked for about two weeks then nothing . Checked both ends for good connection but still no power through it . Put my old one back on that I use on my motorcycle and device works fine . So I put the new back in and wiggled the plug end of the wire and was able to get power if I held the wire to one side . Junk !
  The batteries worked for several months as backups to my canon battery . They were left in between projects for several months , now they will barely hold a charge . Use at your own discretion .
  Pictures are beautiful printed on this paper . I prefer glossy versus matte finish and have been very happy with the results .
  I purchased this printer because it was one of the first to get Vista drivers . I wish I would have waited . I have no problem with the printer itself . Its fast , clear , good quality . The software is the worst and they wont update it . I used the printer first wirelessly and then with the ethernet . both were failures , The printer icons would disapear off multiple computers every few days requiring me to reinstall the software . Support wanted me to disable their own printer detection services . Which didn't help . I have 4 computers in my house and I have reinstalled the printer drivers over 40 times in 6 months . Dont buy this if you like doing this . HP support is the worst too . I didnt get help until I figured out the CEOs name and sent him a email directly . BTW Im installing the drivers again while I write this review .
  Like many reviewers , my iPod Shuffle was defective out of the box . Naively , I spent hours loading and reloading , reseting , etc as laid out on the Apple website . I finally found a number for customer support and sent it back . I got no apology for the defective hardware . I was told that I should be happy that they were sending me a replacement as if the fact that the brand new one I bought being defective was somehow my fault . The replacement has worked fine so far . I am keeping my fingers crossed . I wish I had immediately sent it back instead of messing with it for hours . It was clearly bad hardwareIf you buy a Shuffle and have any issues with it , send it back right away ! Don't follow their directions thinking that there may be software problems that can fixed . These are made in China with evidently no quality control check . Some are just made wrong and will not work .
  I 'm a bit perplexed at another review that stated the microphone does not work with Windows XP ( Service Pack 2 ) ; in fact , it almost prevented me from purchasing . Nevertheless , I took a chance , and I 'm glad I did . All I had to do was plug the jack in , and I was off and running . Sound quality is best at about 6 inches away , although tone is muted a bit . I was very impressed , however , at the complete absence of background noise - despite the fact that my washer and dryer were both running , and my wife and kids were talking and watching television only a few feet away . For my weekly podcast , this is the perfect choice . Interweb research shows the next best microphone to be in the $ 60-$80 price range so the $ 20 price makes the Logitech USB Desktop Microphone a no-brainer . As for that Service Pack 2 issue , it 's possible that the difficulty was the result of another problem ( such as a conflict ) , or it 's possible an update has rendered the problem obsolete . In any case , mine worked right out of the box . Highly recommended .
  Bought this printer in April . Probably printed 20 pages on it in 3 months since I have another printer hooked up . When it worked it printed great pictures . Ink cartridges ran run out too quickly though . In July it died . Got a " paper jam " error without any paper in it . Contacted HP service , which is overseas in Asia now . Mostly the rep read off what you can find on their web page . Most of the time I couldn't understand him anyway . It wasted 1 hr until they agreed to send a remanufactured one to replace the broken printer . 10 days later , the replacement showed up . All was well until the next morning . The color cartridge has some kind of leaked and I needed to run the clean cycle a few time to get it to print in color every time the printer sat for more than 12 hrs . With how little ink is in the HP 95 , this was a problem . So I called them again this time I spoke to a supervisor . They sent another remanufactured printer . 10 days later is showed up . And guess what , it doesn't work . The second replacement will not power up . This was after the supervisor said he would make sure QA double checked the printer before it went out .. Currently I 'm working with a case manager ( one step higher than a supervisor ) , who is not very helpfully . It 's been three days and still no solution . I originally bought a C4150 , and they sent a c4180 . Seems like there are a lot of broken 4180s . If they send back a 4150 , I 'll return it and get my money back and buy a Canon . Its too bad , my old HP printer is 7 yrs old and working great . I wanted an all in one to clear up some space ..
  I have been looking for something to replace the unit the kids have been using . We got tired of the fights over which DVD to play so we went looking for separate units that wouldn't empty the wallet . The main features we wanted were : Tablet style ( or flip into one ) , SD or USB card support , DIVX support and IR heaphones . Well , this unit delivered all of it except the IR headphones . When we received the unit I immediately put in an SD card from my phone . The music on it began playing instantly . Good start . Next loaded up some XVID movies I had ripped and they played perfectly . Finally plugged in my Archos 605 ( 80gb ) player and it actually read the directory but took about 2 minutes . I could select a movie to play but it locked up . I had heard there are problems with large USB hard drives so it may be true . Minor problem since I wouldn't give my kids the 605 anyway . The headrest bra works great and the speakers are way better than expected . It does feel cheap like others have noted but it seems to work great . My son will give it the true endurance test . So we ordered another and now have 2 units with separate DVD players , SD cards loaded with movies and music for each child and headphones . That 's it . All for about $ 300 which is a bargain for this much value . If I get 2 years out of each unit I 'll be happy and would probably go buy another one . Now if only we can get rid of the wired headphones . Hope this helps .
  With minimum use the system stopped working correctly after about three months . Would receive frequent " unlock scanner " messages on console eventhough scanner wasn't locked ( I never even used the scanner ) . Became so frustrating .. Support was useless and non-responsive from the company . Wouldn ; t recommend this product to anyone .. I thenbought an HP PSC850 to replace it .. no problems yet and am happy with it
  The item arrived in a separate metalic envelope without any instructions . I plugged it into my computer . My computer didn't recognize it . I tried to install it through control panel and my computer didn't recognize it there either . It may work at my work site because my computer is newer there , but who knows . I don't recommend to the average computer software user .
  .. which isn't really saying much , when you consider how pathetic the five hundred dollar Bose Wave radio is . People , it 's not rocket science : if you want quality sound you , miniaturizing and cramming together all your components into one tiny little box is NEVER going to do the trick-don't fall for all the advertising snake oil about " revolutionary technology , " " virtual surround sound , " etc . At the very least a compact stereo system like the one hundred eighty dollar Sony CMTHPX9 has * detachable * speakers so you can get proper stereo separation and proper speaker placement . Or the Sony MHC-GX450 for an extra twenty dollars has a detachable subwoofer as well , not the ludicrous what , 3-inch subwoofer this Cambridge radio has ? Either of these would blow this thing clear out of the water ! Even better would be to browse jandr . com for something like a cheap receiver ( Sherwood 7108 , $ 130 ) , cheap CD / DVD player ( Toshiba 3960 , $ 50 ) , and speakers ( Polk R15s , $ 100 / pair ) which would still cost less and would easily deliver five times better sound . Ah , form factor-yes that 's about the only thing that this Cambridge and that Bose Wave has going for it : I suppose if you live in a tiny five by ten foot closet ( a NYC apartment perhaps ? ) it might be useful to have something this small . Otherwise you are much better buying one of those compact stereos and a cheap clock radio for your bedside , which would probably cost you about half as much for far better sound quality !
  I had a laptop which required me to remove the CD if I wanted a 3.5 inch floppy drive . What a pain ! This external floppy drive pluges into the USB port and I was fully functioanl using CD and floppy drive functions without the cumbersome effort to switch bays . Worked smoothly . Well worth the money the first day .
  I have filled this puppy up to capacity and i love it . Really good construction , durable , and the handle is really rugged but still aesthetically pleasing .
  I am not reviewing how this works b / c i am sure it works as well as all other ipods but .. i am shocked how expensive it is for a 4gb player . I know its an ipod so it will be expensive but you can get a 20gb player ( non-ipod ) for about the same price , maybe a little more . It is clear that you are not paying for gbs here but style . I understand that but it still seems like a high price to pay for fashion . I just want to listen to music !
  For $ 13 I cannot think of a better investment to your Nikon inventory . Slim , easy , and works great . No more running into the shot and trying to compose yourself with less than 1 second to go . Uses : - Spares you from racing into a photo - Easily capture multiple frames from a distance - Avoid any camera shake during long exposures .
  This memory card is one of the best cards ive bought for my psp . The card holds up lots of music , photos , and movies . This is worth like say about 20-30 dollars at the game store . But instead buy it here on amazon for about 15 $ . I recommend you buy this memory card .
  But I didn't give a s * , because I only paid 5 dollars for the card in the first place . The card works great in my GPS , I 'm just a little burnt over not getting the SD Adapter .
  i bought these , hoping to use them while working out . the sound quality was great , they were nice and lightweight , but within 2 lousy weeks one side went staticky and then stopped altogether . i do not recommend these for anything other than gentle use . wish i 'd read some of the other comments before i got them !
  I purchsed these after purchasing Sony ear phones . My comparison is based upon the Sony versus the Etymotics . The Sony Earphones were on Sale at a local chain for $ 5 from $ 20 . The Etymotics were $ 60 . The Etymotics have excellent sound and good bass . You should only use them with the foam eartips installed . These eartips filter out all background noise and do make them sound a lot better . I was able to listen to music on a plane and hear it clearly with no background interference from either jet engines or annoying idiots sitting next to me that would rather talk than read . I personally like a lot of bass when I listen to music . Mainly , I listen to Classic Rock , heavy metal , Hard rock etc . I use them with my iPhone and have the Equalizer set on Rock . These are better than the Sony earphones when considering the things I mentioned . They are also more comfortable . You can wear them for long periods without your ear bothering you . ( Remember Foam Tips ) Are they worth $ 55 more than the Sony 's ? If you are truly interested in good bass sound and background noise filtering then yes , they are worth the money . If not , go to your local Wallymart and get the Sony earphones . If you value good bass sound from your iPod / iPhone then spend the money for the Etymotic ER6i and also get an extra bag of foam ear tips .
  Remember the printer from Office Space ? Well this is it , in spirit if not in form . Usually it works pretty well .. until you either turn it off or have to replace an ink cartridge . Turning it off , then turning it on again ( regardless of the time between the two events ) typically results in the scanner getting jammed during it 's initialization and making a horrible juddering noise which simply will not cease until the unit is turned off again . Replacing the ink cartridges results in wasting approximately 1 deciduous forest 's worth of paper , as it will print endless alignment pages , but then fail to scan these when they are placed on the scanner as instructed . I have spent way , way too much time fighting with this machine in a futile effort to get it to work . Often multiple reboots have been necessary , and I have yet to work out any method in the madness . Undoubtedly among the most frustrating computer accessory I have ever had the misfortune to come across . HP should be ashamed for even marketing this peice of garbage , and whoever designed it should resign . Oh , wait , corporate ethics is an oxymoron in the US . Guess I can look forward to more poorly-designed crap in the future .
  Bought this to add iPOD playbak to my 2003 Tahoe and it worked for a minute or two then the headunit ejected the adapter . Now I can't get it to stay in and play for more than a couple seconds . When it did play the sound was inferior to even a casette tape .
  I was concerned that splitting the signal 4 ways would degrade the picture quality but this device worked perfectly and without any signal loss . I use this to split a DVD player onto 4 tvs in my shop and I 'm very happy with the results .
  I 'm re-editing my previous review . I initially gave it 4 stars because at first I was pleased with the mouse but wasn't sure on the battery life . I 'm on my 2nd Targus mouse and it SUCKS ! Never buying this again . The battery life is terrible and about a week after I used it wirelessly - it never worked again without being connected to the USB cord . It 's not like I used this mouse everyday either - I took good care of it , kept it in the pouch it came with and it just never worked as well as it did after the first week . I 've tried re-charging etc but this product is not worth buying . If I knew then what I know now , I would have saved the money and just bought a Mac mouse . You 'll have a worthless mouse after a couple of uses and although it is very easy to use , it becomes less of a useful accessory and more of an annoyance . I would never ever buy this mouse again .
  If you really must have a removable media MP3 player , this one isn't it . If I could rate 0 stars , I would . Biggest problems are it has no display , it won't find songs in folder , since it won't find songs in a folder , it 's limited to only a hundred or so selections ( there is a hard limit on the number of files at " root " level , which I discovered upon trying to load up a 2Gig card and could only get about a half megs worth of stuff loaded before the card crapped out . I ended up replacing this POS with a " JukeM @ n jWIN " for $ 15 and it 's A LOT better . The jWIN allows for your MP3 's to be in folders , so you can fully load the card with songs , on top of that it has a well lit display and good shuffle play , etc .
  Best headphones I 've ever used . Got these for the office to replace the Apple Earbuds I had been using . I couldn't believe the difference in comfort and sound quality .
  I have bought a copy of this lens for a pentax k-20 and k-7 . It is the worst lens i have in my collection . The international warrenty is completly useless . Do not travel and buy this lens . I have had it for three months and it is a good paper weight . I have tried to get international warrenty on the lens and no one in asia services the lens or does not have the equipment to work on it . The autofocus is so far out it is worthless . Sigma says send it in with camera at my own expense . What a rip off . The IQ is very poor for a lens like this . I suggest buying a paper weight for 5 dollars . And not a 3000 dollar one .
  Overall : some nice features but overall bad . Both the mouse and keyboard need a redesign . Mouse : THe highlight of the pair obviouly . The goal is to cut down on mouse use as this for me at least is what slows me down and makes my hand hurt . I got this package soley for the scroll buttons on either side of the mouse wheel . THe laser is gimmicky but fine . too many functions . THe scroll button is beautiful ( though it gets stuck as another mentioned ) . However the wheel is in the way of the back side button and prevents its use . Get rid of the wheel and now you are talking . THe thumb buttons are more easily accessed without requiring too much motion of the thumb . ( the top middle finger is required to travel way to far past the scroll wheel to be of any use , the thumb is on the borderline of this occurring ) . Again to cluttered . The application switcher is in the middle causing the need to feel your way around the buttons . Application switcher : useless feature as most monitors are large enought to display task bar on the right . I can read all 5 excel files i have open and easily click the one I want . Keyboard : I should have looked closer at this . Arrogantly redesigned . I love my old multimedia keyboard so much more . I programmed in all my necessary websites in the provided web buttons . No web buttons on this keyboard . Now your main programmable buttons are your function keys . Many workplaces already program those for you to work related tasks . I also personally like keyboard short cuts ( cut , past , close ( alt f4 ) . If I were to enable the programmable buttons , I lose my windows close button ( and the f keys are small so hard to hit anyway . ANother big change is the number pad . It has a very non standard bevelling and it looks like the left keys 1,4,7 are fatter than the others . If you type numbers in without looking at the screen ( looking at your data for example ) , the tactile response of the number pad is way off and you will have numerous numerous errors . The highlight is the window scroller on the left . Innovative and takes pressure off your need of the mouse . Oh , BTW the delete button has grown which I originally noticed and didn't care as i use delete alot . HOwever , this displaced the end button ( and I navigate excel very quickly and effectively without mouse using the end button in combination with shifts and cntrls . ) Good bye to the way you use your keyboard with this one . It is a stylized piece of junk .
  I was searching for a tiny micro system for my office , and being a fan of Phillips products , checked their web site and found this line . I saw that the local Best Buy sold these units , so I went there for a test listen . Comparing all of the small units side-by-side there , this one really showed it 's true colors ! Smooth , silky sound ( you can't beat ribbon tweeters ! ) , easy to use , clean , compact design .. I could go on and on . Yes , I bought one ! My ONLY complaint is I cannot tune in the few radio stations that I prefer ( my office is in a commercial steel building ) , but the iPod hooked right up to it and I 'm quite satisfied !
  The tape cartridges arrived as promised within the expected time-frame . All the cartriges were put into service successfully with no failures . We 've had to return some we 've ordered from others in the past , because the were unusable right out of the box . All six of these are hard at work !
  This is one item I should have returned . There was a short in the wire or something so most of the time I had to fiddle with it just to get it to come on . Changing stations - forget it - if I had to touch the thing , it was too sensitive and would shut off and I 'd have to keep turning it back on . It finally died completely on me recently . Nice sleek design but what a disappointment .
  I have bought several of these 8Gb and 16Gb cards in the last 2 years and althgough they are fast and highly compatible , I already lost half of the 16Gb batch ( 3 actually ) . They simply died in the middle of a transfer operation , never to recover . I know that flash memory cards are usually not the best media when it comes to reliability , but one of these failed me in less than a week . Never got any problems with the 8Gb versions ( I have 4 of those ) . My advise : use them only as transfer media ( go for the class 10 instead , it is well worth the few extra bucks ) and never , never for backup purposes . And don't dispose of the original files until you have them safely stored on a reliable media .
  I purchased this camcorder / digital camera in May 2002 and found that it takes excellent video , is easy to use , and seemed to be a good value . Unfortunately my good first impression came to an end . Despite every trick known to a computer geek and following Panasonic 's instructions to the letter , I cannot get the camera to " talk " to my PC . Therefore the digital camera function is worthless to me now . Panasonic 's product literature states the Windows 95/98 / Me / 2000 OS is required . I am using Windows XP . So I went to Panasonic 's website to download the newest iteration of the software but that didn't solve the problem . I called Panasonic 's customer service and despite numerous busy signals , finally reached a rep who was basically clueless . It might be the cable , but I don't want to buy a new one . I 'd really like Panasonic to solve the problem !
  Purchased this to use during our county search and rescue missions and to play with doing some geocashing . Does a great job and really like the electronic compus . Would be nice if it didn't cost so much to add the extra maps but for now it is OK .
  Product arrived on time and functions as described . I would recommend this product for anyone wanting to store a large number of DVD 's or CD 's . The only slight issue is that it 's slightly difficult to zip it shut once a lot of DVD 's are in it . Not a real problem and it gets a little easier once you get used to it . I actually just put it back on the shelf unzipped most of the time as it doesn't really need to be zipped shut to sit on the shelf .
  I loved it when it worked : great features , no problems with WMA , good battery life ( though not as good as advertised ) . But after a couple of months it became prone to freezing when reading MP3 and WMA files , which became increasingly worse over time , and now it won't even read factory-pressed CDs . The disc just spins and spins , trying to boot up but failing . I didn't drop it or abuse it in any way . This is a huge disappointment .
  This system has been a blessing for me . I used to print CD 's one at a time and it was a real pain . As my business grew I needed more power . I recieved this two days before my daughter was born and set it up to use while I was on PAternity duty . It setup easy and ran very low maintenance . I was running it on a computer that was doing nothing but that , and technically not up to the spec they recommend . Occassionally I have to reboot the machine , but that 's the case with any windows machine . I think it approx . 18 months I have likely burned and printed about 6000 CD 's . Business is growing again and I recently bought a high speed duplicator . That machine cost me $ 1100 and will do 11 CD 's or 43 seconds for me so my bravo is just used for printing now . I strongly recommend this . It 's not perfect , but nothing with moving parts that is used alot is going to be no maintenance forever . This machine has been a stud for me ..
  Horrible product . Owned the Surge protector for about a month , then started to hear a sizzling noise . Thank goodness my laptop was not plugged in at the time . Never ever buying a Belkin product again !
  It 's a great idea , but the device broke after just one year . Also , Ceiva is kind of scummy - they won't refund your yearly subscription fee if you cancel after 180 days - sounds illegal , but who 's going to fight over $ 40 .
  It was easy to set up , but wasn't worth the effort . The DVDs got stuck and the VHS stopped working altogether - after only 2 months .
  this product is good for small speakers .. won't push 10 " or 12 " inch speakers ..
  I 've been using the nuvi360 for about 8 months now , and while it 's been a lifesaver , it hasn't done anything that any other GPS could do . My biggest problem is that the screen is polarized 90 degrees off axis . If you 're using polarized glasses the screen is black . I 've driven about 3500 miles this summer and had to use the thing at a goofy 45 degree angle and tip my head just so I could see the screen . The only reason I didn't return it is because it was a gift . This is a major engineering blunder in the screen fabrication . There are tons of alternatives out there . Get one of those instead .
  I use this gps holder on my mountain bike and it supports very well all kind of abuse , hits on the ground , vibrations , etc . Very well made product with a strong plastic and a hard fix to the bike .
  I have abnormally small ears and ear piercings in my cartiledge which make ear buds one of the only options for headphone comfort . These earbuds are great - all the others fall out of my ears and these , with the larger covers to make them fit even snugger , sit wonderfully and don't fall out when I run , go to the gym , etc . I 'm a petite 20something so maybe that explains the discrepency in reviews . But I have been nothing but thrilled with these headphones . FINALLY earbuds that don't fall out of little ears !
  When my original WRT54G router final gave up the ghost after almost 5 years of continous service ( telecomuting from my home office by day , internet surfing by night ) , I purchased a Linksys WRT120N wireless router locally because I needed to get back " on the air " quickly , What a total piece of crap the WRT120N turned out to be , I wish I had found and read the review at [ .. ] before wasting my money on itOk , so what does this have to do with a review of a Linksys WRT54L router ? Well , I want to also pass on a warning about the WRT120N and say why I ended up replacing it with a WRT54L.The WRT120N is a 802.11n router billed as being backwards with 802.11g but it is not ! It is very unreliable and after finding myself needing to constantly do a power off / on reset due to it sporadically " locking " up I decided it was high time to give it the boot after a few weeks of that nonsense and go back to a WRT54 series wireless router . The WRT54L couldn't arrive soon enough to replace the WRT12N and much to my pleasant surprise it showed up days ahead of the timeframe Amazon gave for the Super Saver shipping . The WRT54L is a tried and true WRT54 series router that uses Linux firmware instead of Cisco 's firmware . That opens up a whole new world in being able to tweak the router 's performance by installing a 3 party firmware such as DD-WRT , if desired . For me , that was not necessary as it provides a strong enough wifi signal to be able to connect from any area of my multi level home . But I sure like having that option available even if it 's not needed at this time , Installation was a breeze and a much improved process than what I went through with my original WRT54G router . Bottom line .. BUY THIS ROUTER if you are lookng for your first router or a replacement , you will not be disappointed .
  I really don't understand how anyone could possibly think that this is a good design . I considered buying this backpack and a similar one by Jeep , but quickly realized that it was guaranteed to break almost anything you could possibly carry in it other than clothing because of the single center bar . To demonstrate the problem , put a pencil against the corner of your kitchen counter . Press on both ends of the pencil . What happens ? The pencil breaks . The kitchen counter is acting as a fulcrum , the pencil as a lever with substantial force on both ends . In a similar fashion , when you put a book in this sort of backpack , everything else in the bag is pushing on both sides of that book , but the book is supported only in the center by that single vertical post . Unless you only carry light stuff in the bag , you 're almost guaranteed to end up with bent notebooks , books with broken backs , laptops with cracked screens , and so on . It 's quite possibly the worst backpack design mistake in the history of backpacks . If you don't care about the stuff you 're carrying , by all means , buy one of these . If what you are carrying has any value at all , do yourself a favor and buy something with a more traditional double handle or wait for the designers to come up with a single handle built into a solid back so that it doesn't turn your cargo into a lever with a heavy weight at both ends . There 's not enough crack in the world for this design to make sense .
  If you 're a frequent traveler , these will help you retain your sanity . I looked at the Bose ones , but couldn't justify the 2x price . The Audio-Technica work great and the price was more attractive than others .
  Received item . Power on the item doesn't light up . Call DLink tech support found out that the item was defective . Returning item to Amazon . Looking for another one .
  Buyer beware of this keyboard , terrible performance ! This keyboard experiences horrible performance issues with this keyboard , if the wireless transciever is moved away , this keyboard malfunctions and sometimes will not register key clicks . I 've had to purchase a Microsoft Keyboard 6000 becuase I couldn't take this keyboard anymore . Do NOT buy ! You will regret it !
  The Casio Exilim EXZ55 competes head to head with the Canon SD400 and SD450 . Likes : The Casio zoom control is in a more convenient place than the Canon . It is right where my thumb wants it to be . The Canon zoom is on a ring around the shutter button and I feel like I 'm going to drop the camera when I zoom out . The Casio battery life is almost three times as long as the Canon . So long that you should not worry if you forgot your spare battery . The Casio battery can be charged inside the camera using the docking station ( the Canon battery must be removed from the camera to charge ) . The docking station is also a little more convenient than Canon 's loose cable if you want to use USB to upload pictures . Dislikes : I think the Canon does a little better job in low light situations with no flash . The Casio images look a little " blocky " on close inspection . However , with flash , the Casio does a better job . The Casio has very even lighting ( I think it has digital compensation to reduce dark corners .
  This curling iron is terrible , which is a shame because all the reviews are generally positive . It burns my hair and doesn't curl AT ALL . I 've tried the different heat settings , smaller and bigger chunks of hair and leaving it in for awhile - it just does not work . I have straight fine hair and I have never experienced this problem with any curling iron in the past .
  Will this card run The Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion ?
  The light is bright and Very easy to use , Just plug and play , but its so top heavy that it wont stay up at all unless you have it hang over the laptop screen . However If you have your laptop in your vehicle like I do , It don't stay still period even if it 's supported by the screen . So I 'm not to happy with it .
  The seller was supposed to have sold me the Energy 8 charger , but sent me the Energy 8 PLUS which is a slightly different model . They expect me to return their mistake at my expense .. not happy at all . As far as the product , it works ok as long as you make sure that the neg / pos connections are completely connected since there is room for error . It has also given me an error on a battery , but after moving it into another slot , it worked fine ..
  I got this little puppy for my Macintosh after researching various USB Smartmedia readers from brand name digital camera makers ( that go for $ 60-70 ) for my Olympus D-360 camera . This was half-price ! It 's simple to use and a fast way to get your pics into your computer . The card just comes up as a disk on your desktop and from there you can open the pictures right from the card itself or copy them to your drive in a jiffy !
  NOTE : I bought this in the States , didn't open it until I arrived in Germany , and it has only been used in Europe . I work in Germany and wanted to get a GPS to get around without spending too much on a GPS . Obviously GPS systems with only US maps are cheaper than any dual US / Europe GPS , so I researched different brands and models that were compatible with online map upgrades . I found a great pick with the TomTom One XL . I bought the system when on sale for $ 200 , and I bought the " Western Europe " map upgrade online for $ 120 ( thru TomTom home ) . There is not enough internal memory , so I put the new map on a SD card . I had a few issues after purchase and download of the Europe map , but customer service was great ( no waiting on the phone , and they stayed on with me until the issue was fixed ) . OK , so the new map wasn't as simple as " plug-n-play , " but after 30 minutes on the phone with U.S. customer service troubleshooting my problem , I ran a flash file on my XL , I turned on the system , and after 45 seconds of searching for sattelites , the GPS was tracking my location in Germany . The interface is adequate , with large buttons on the 4.3 " screen that make it easy to choose . The tracking of my location has pin-point accuracy , and when I turn on the system , it takes less than 60 seconds to locate my position . My mount is solid , and I have excellent reception without any tacky antennas . POIs are slacking , but I 'm just trying to get from point A to point B. I 'm a basic user . Overall , I 'm very pleased with this US / Canada / W Europe GPS for only $ 320 total . It has been a great convenience getting around city and rural Europe , especially since road signs and names can be confusing here .
  The connection to the Palm Tungsten T is so loose as others mention that the charge light goes on and off by itself . Its hard to believe that a reputable company can say that this works for this model . I wish i had read these comments before i purchased it . The bulky original cradle is such a piece of [ junk ] that im thinking of switching to a Microsoft PDA due to the better designs from the companies making them - don't laugh , i switched from Nikon to Canon Digital Camera 's due to Canon 's much better charger which needs no wires . The travel charger doesnt seem to be a solution - Palm , get your act together before you lose ALL your customers !
  I purchased this so I could have power for my GPS on my snowmobile . If you don't have a cigarette plug on yours , go to your local electronics store and get yourself a bridge rectifier , cut the plug off of this and connect to the rectifier , tap into 12 VAC and ground on the sled for the other 2 connectors on the rectifier and you 've got power . You do still need batteries because the voltage gets weak at idle , but there is plenty off idle . Get the bicycle mount for GPS to mount on handlebars . Been using this setup for a few years . Works great and is a smart idea in unfamiliar territory .
  I waited for this case to come off back order and I am so glad that I did . I also have the body glove case which is great . This case is durable , zips all the way around , has more pocket space than the body glove , is waterproof , and has a removable carry handle . It isn't quite as padded as the body glove case but the carry handle should keep me from dropping it . I was tired of seeing everything I own in black and I love the red and blue Hawaiin print . Even though I 'm working , it reminds me of being on vacation . This is a fun yet practical case . A great price too . I may buy another one in a jungle print to brighten my black briefcase !
  Besides being big and ugly , this antenna did no better than a cheap pair of rabbit ears . I returned it and got the Philips MANT410 which works at my house perfectly .
  This is a standard a . v . selector , made by monster cable . Monster cable does make some of the best cables around , they are all I use for my audio , even though they are a lil pricey . But monster means quality . But .. Its just not worth the price tag on this thing ! For top of the line quality nothing beats this , but if you can afford this then you can afford a t . v . with 4 s video inputs such as the top of the line sony wega , so why not spend your money on that ? Its good quality , but I think I 'll spend my money for the $ 50 rca one , or even find another one for less , but if you got money to burn on a selector , go ahead , but the money can buy alot better things .
  This camera sounds good in specs , but the pictures are what you 'd expect from an inexpensive digital camera . The colors are washed out , and the images are poor quality . Spend a little more money and get a betterr camera .
  I bought 2 of these battery and 1 the them will only be good for 1 hour of shooting . Disappointed .
  It broke both times . I returned it . You stand on teh cord once and it breaks . Amazon do you have a wireless one ? It would be nice . Get one !
  I bought this coffee pot to replace my mom 's old one which was still working , but the cord was not fitting securely into the pot any longer so it needed to go . She used the first one for probably over 10 years and used it every day . It makes the best coffee .
  I purchased this product to transfer Hi8 to DVD , and was completely disappointed . Video quality is poor at best . Color is particularly bad - washed out , rainbows soaring thru the video , strange artifacts , and bursts of dropped frames ( even though Pinnacle 's software always reported zero dropped frames ) . I don't expect Hollywood DVD quality video , but I know what my source video looks like and this product didn't even look as good as streamed Internet video . I might have tolerated the product with its video problems if it weren't for the audio . Others have reported ' no audio capture ' . I didn't experience this but my captures consistently had 10 to 30 seconds of lag between the video and the audio . This made the product completely useless . I can believe that other reviewers didn't just have wiring problems . The user interface is better than most other products , if not outright brilliant . The feature set looks great but I didn't waste the time to try most of it since the core functionality just isn't there . I am running a 2.8GHz P4 with 512M RAM and 80G drive , so I was well above min specs . I used XP Pro w / SP2 . In fairness , others have reported install problems on XP and I had no such problems . I did have multiple lockups while the software was running , and even Task Manager couldn't always kill it .
  Do not buy this product ! I purchased one for my mother , and she could not turn the tuning dial . We returned it for another , and then that one broke . Since it was purchased 60 days ago , Amazon will not handle a refund or replacement , and we must go to the manufacturer . A very big disappointment all around .
  I am using this to feed video to an LCD projector . I was afraid that the picture quality would suffer , but no worries . It looks great . Vibrant colors and no noise . I am not using the audio , so I cannot comment on that . One complaint , though . If you are in the habit of using premium cables you 're out of luck here . The plastic molding on the external case of these units is so close to the outside of the RCA jacks that there is no room for the thicker connectors found on high-end cables . The unit comes with two video / audio cables of the standard variety , and they fit fine . I wish I could use premium cables .
  This is a good sound card for those who wanna be a radio announcer or want to make voice-overs to sFX in radio dramas , but for gamers it 's just a lot of fluff . If you are into recording and singing I suggest going all the way and getting the Platnum ex , if you are into games , I suggest the Gamer version , it 's ( . . . ) cheaper and comes with Giants to boot . This card emulates 5.1 channels in most games but is not as good as Phillips in correctly emulating them . The only games I had a real problem with were Baldur 's Gate Series ( all of them including SoA & ToB ;) . These games cannot emulate speech through the center channel but instead emulate the music / fx in the center . This bothers me personally because BG is my favorite game . Phillips will play speech through center in ToB but not in the others . IceWind Dale works great with this Audigy card but Baldur 's Gate II SoA / ToB is terrible . The best games are Creative 's ' featured ' games , including Diablo , Deus Ex , and a handfull of others . BGII / ToB is on the EAX list but it doesn't work in 5.1 ( at least not appropriately ) ' Advanced ' HD EAX has yet to prove itself . When games come out ( next 6 mo ) This card will show what it can do ( hopefully ) . Not trying to disappoint but the Goldmine Demo was not that impressive to me . This Demo was supposed to show the cards full potential with EAX advanced . Birds chirping arounnd and wing flapping was pretty life like but the other things you can do were nothing shocking . I did notice a bunch of static when I tried to run some game demos in EAX that were supposed to be HD Advanced It is probably a driver issue that will be fixed when EAX 3 comes out . To conclude , do not buy this product just because it 's from Creative , that is not a good reason at all and they 're are better cards out there . Hercules is comming out with Maxi Theater X , a 6.1 sound card ( six speakers and a sub = 7 ! ) For right now there is Phillip 's Acustic Edge which has an excellent player and Power DVD .
  There are really 2 different headphones here : before and after burn-in . You DO need to play this baby for at least 2-3 days non-stop before they open up . The HD-280 are high-quality phones and very revealing , without being aggressive or clinical . Tape hiss on older recordings is enhanced but the sound remains truthful and musical acrosse the spectrum , with no exagerated frequencies , annoying overtones , or distortions . Classical / jazz listeners will be particularly pleased by what they hear . These cans are exceptional value and can be driven by just about everything . Headphones technology must have advanced quite a bit in the last 10 years . Whatever the case , I believe Sennheiser has a winner here . Now repeat with me : I WILL BURN THEM IN .. I WILL BURN THEM IN .. I WILL BURN THEM IN .. I WILL BURN THEM IN ..
  I thought the price was insanely good , would have been nice to know the Shipping & Handling was just as much . I plugged the car charger into my iPhone 3GS and the device said it couldn't use this accessory .. NOW if I want to return the item I don't get my S & H back and there is an excessive restocking fee of 30 % +
  This is one great lens . I had used the 18-55 lens before , and wanted a little extra lens . This lens provided everything I wanted . The extra length was a great enhancement , and the IS is totally incredible . This is one versatile lens , and may be the last lens you ever buy , unless you need a true telephoto ! After buying a Canon 30D ( without lens ) I debated on the standard zoom lens , but am more than thrilled that I went with this one . Extra length and the IS give you the best of both worlds . Great lens !
  I purchased these earbuds and no matter which sleeves i tried i could not get them to stay in . I tried all 3 types . Even the extremely cheap foam ones and nothing amazing happened . I could hear just about everything that was going on ( OUTSIDE ) of my headphones . Finally i got them to get a good seal but then every time i got them to seal it would put a painful pressure on my eardrum . Extremely uncomfortable . ALso the sound lacked bass . The highs were good but it sounded unnatural . I listen to classic rock , jazz , some punk , and a little blues . I returned these 2 days after purchasing them . I switched them for the JBL Reference 220 's . Same idea with the in ear design but a lot more confortable to wear . They work great . The sound is crisp and clean plenty of bass for you bass lovers . You really dont even need to turn on a equalizer . JBL has been in the business for a long time now and know what they are doing . Also it comes with a nifty case with lots of cool adapters . I took these on a plane and they are amazing ! Superb cancellation . I couldnt hear the jets roaring or anything . My suggestion . Get the JBL 's a tad bit cheaper and better sound .
  I have found the sound to be quite pleasant . This would be great as a replacement on an older sound system and also with a new system as well . I think it would work in a 2.1 sound system for lets say a small room / bedroom . The freq . response is very good for the size and price .
  It worked for about 2 weeks on my Inspiron ( XP ) , but then wouldn't be recognized . I tried downloading the driver from IO Gear , but no luck .
  This case looks really great in your hand walking around . It always catches someone 's eye . It also looks really expensive . You can tell it was made to last with the white thread against the black leather accent . There is only one tiny thing I don't like and it 's the material inside the case . It often leaves traces of the black fibre on the camera but only detectable if you hold as close as your nose , but like I say that 's very minor .
  I ordered a pack of 100 Verbatim DVD-R 's because of the high rating they were given . They were not the ' life series ' , and they DID have the AZO layer on it ( not sure what that is ) - since that seems to be the sign of high quality with these discs . I was so excited to try them out , but the very first disc I set to burn was not even recognized . Second one was recognized , burned , and finalized successfully , however when I placed it into my 2 $ 29.99 DVD Players - Memorex ( manufactured in 2010 ) DVD Player and Philips ( also 2010 ) which by the way have played EVERY single burnt disc I 've ever placed in them , Memorex gave me a WRONG DISC error , of which I had NEVER seen on that DVD player , and the Philips simply didn't do anything ( again , never seen it do that ) . Since that day , I 've resorted to burning at 2x just to get them to work , although I 've NEVER had to do this with ANY brand I 've used before . I 've made 100 's of movies with second rate brands , all of which play on my cheap players , and I can think of only a handful that simply wouldn't burn . Just as a test , I burned Wrath of the Titans onto a Verbatim at 6x , and it had pixelization errors when I played it . Did the same burn onto a Philips DVD-R , at same speed , same program , etc , and it came out fine . So , why did I go with Verbatim ? I hear they are high quality and since I give a lot of DVD 's to friends , I wanted high compatibility as well . Now I 'm stuck with 84 Verbatims that I HAVE to burn at 2x or they just won't work . Can somebody please just let me know if you 've had this problem ? I can't be the only one .. these are supposed to be the sh * t when it comes to DVD 's , it can't just be me . Thanks . BTW , out of 16 DVD 's I 've burned so far , 5 messed up .. they either weren't recognized or were recognized and burned successfully but then gave some kind of errors on DVD player .
  I have speakers on my porch and speakers in the house . This switch allows me to listen only in the house , only on the porch , or all at once . Istalled in a standard wall electrical box which allowed me to conceal all the speaker wires inside the wall . And it was cheap !
  Initially when I saw this product I was thinking whether to buy Memory sticks on brands other than Sony . I just had my Sony Clie and I wanted to get the largest possible memory sticks available . Lexar sells their sticks about half the price of Sony . So I bought it ( actually a few ) , and I have absolutely no problems with it . No files have been lost on the stick ( I have used it for more than half a year ) , and the access speed is OK too . Packaging is excellent , takes forever to rip it open though :p With this price it is definitely worth while .
  The iPod gives you a truly portable music collection . It 's very small , about the size of a deck of cards , and fits easily in pockets - even your shirt 's breast pocket . Depending on the model it can store anywhere from 1000 songs ( 5GB ) to 4000 songs ( 20GB ) . The dial / button interface is wonderful . It lets you quickly and easily access the music you 're in the mood for . It can shuffle by song or by album - a feature I 've looked for in CD jukeboxes for years . It uses information from your computer about a song 's relative loudness to ensure that all of your songs from different albums play at a consistent volume . In addition to playing music it can synchronize itself with your address book and calendar . It also includes a version of the Breakout video game . And , I 've dropped mine a few times from a height of 2 to 4 feet onto a variety of surfaces from carpeting to concrete and it still plays and looks fine .
  I read the manufacturers product description and it sounded just like what I was looking for . " It works with virtually any device with a USB port - even cross-platform from Macintosh to PC and vice versa . " When I received the drive , however , it wouldn't work with Mac OS 9 . I am running OS 10 but a lot of the files I wanted to back up were created with OS 9 . There was no information on the web site about supported versions . My OS 9 files were not recognised . I was understandable upset . I contacted Kingston for support and was give a tech solution that was not guarented to work and a disclamer : " If these steps do not work for you then unfortunately there is nothing else we can do for you . " So much for their " five-year warranty and Kingston 's legendary service and support . " The steps didn't work and I am not able to back up the files I need so I guess I am out of luck and Kingston is out a future customer . Lose . Lose .
  Pluuged it in , working nice , transferred a couple gigs of video , unmounted , unplugged . It wouldn't turn on again . The moral of this story is to stick to known brands . Ugh .
  I got this thing for Christmas , I wasn't expecting it , so eventhough I was planning on buying the Linksys version eventually , this was a nice suprise . The only thing I had a little problem with is setting it up . The included software treats you like you are stupid and tries to force you to do their automatic setup software crap that DOESNT WORK.I finally went to DLINK 's website and figured out the IP address to log into the router and manually set it up myself . The instructions on Dlink 's website were clear and concise , and after reading it I was able to manually set up the router myself . I like the freedom of being able to use my BellSouth fastaccess service on work laptop anywhere in my home without having to be in the computer room . Before this router if I wanted to use my laptop in my bedroom I would have to resort to using this POS Verizon Broadband access PC5470 PC card that absolutely sucks , slower than dialup and even more unreliable . Not anymore though , now I can use my reliable home ISP on my laptop anywhere I choose to go in my homeMy other computers are still connected to the dlink router with wires as I don't plan to move them around the house . If you don't use the automatic setup crap , then you will find that its pretty simple to set up . Don't forget your encryption key !
  MY Ipod Mini is really cool . I got the green one . Its really easy to use and great for car rides , exersising and just for enjoyment . A couple of warnings : If you buy the dock DONT use it all the time because the paint will chip off . Also dont use the Belt clip a lot becuase the paint will chip off too . I would reccomend getting a car charger , apple care , dock , and an armband . Same with armband dont use it a lot because the paint will chip off .
  I have no complains about the sound quality of the subwoofer but .. I received the product today with the speaker grill cover broken , the manuals were crumpled , looks like they sent to me a returned iten , can't confirm that was but looks like . Another thing is the price , they droped the price on amazon 1 after after I bought , I should return and buy again in another place but I won't do it , I hope amazon can take care of that .
  Nice price , Great sound . Only lacking an on / off button on the desktop speakers . Amazing bass .
  This is a very cheap piece of equipment . I had another version of this that came with my camera that looked very similar but worked much better . This product is a very cheap replacement and I recommend you don't waste your money and instead choose one that may cost a bit more . It does not bend well , springs back immediately to where it wants to be , and will not stand up on uneven surfaces very well . Choose another !
  I keep this on the side of my shower , so I will admit it has not gotten splashed much with water , but it seems to hold up well to the humidity . The sound is really impressive , loud and audible . Pretty easy to set up as well .
  I was very enthusiastic about this purchase . The design is amazing and it was the perfect product of my needs .. on paper . But , after using it several times in SD card mode without a hitch , I switched it to USB Stick mode and it just flat out rebooted the computer . My guess is that it created a surge in the USB 2.0 port on my Lenovo T60p which are not known to fail . I tried again , same result this time with XP not being able to recognize the card . When it was removed from the USB port , the computer restarted again . Now no device I have can recognize it . This could be a fluke based on all the other reviews ( why I bought the card ) but not mine .
  It 's hard to find a high-end DVD / CD player with 5 disc capability . Most today are only single disc . The SACD audio is awesome , but make sure you use the individual channel outputs for SACD as the optical out does not work on SACD for my tuner . Picture clarity is great and near HD quality . If you want a single unit to run high-end DVD and audio , buy this unit . The only complaint I have is that there is not a shuffle button on the unit , you have to use the remote .
  This Canon camera bag is a great fit for my digital Rebel , two lenses , two filters in individual cases , extra batteries and media cards , and even my personal GPS unit - and there 's plenty of space for it all ! Outside pockets allow me to carry my battery charger , a mini tripod , and even the camera manual with room left over ! I 'm so glad I purchased this camera bag !
  Well , I thought I couldn't go wrong giving this cable a try since it is so inexpensive and I am still glad I did so , because now I know what I do now . And that is ; Price really does matter . I received this cable and it is much worse due to artifacts then my component cables . There are large white / black diamonds and blocks ( several pixels ) every few seconds that appear randomly all over my screen for split seconds . HDMI is digital so I figured it is either on or off . Correct , but there still can be interference , and the single may get messed up , and this creates artifacts . Anyways , if you have any doubts it really doesn't hurt to try these cheap cables . But for people who don't want to waste the time , just go with expensive well made cables .
  Fits my lens great . It helps protect my glass . Pretty cheap investment to protect your glass .
  I ordered one strip of Viking DL1356 512MB for my Dell Inspiron 600m , the machine that this memory model is supposedly designed for . The DL1356 memory continuously freezes my computer . I even tried having the DL1356 installed without any other memory strips ; still froze my computer . I should have trusted the_verdugo 's review .
  We have been using these binoculars for some time now and it works great . We had a similar pair like this but misplaced it on a trip to Hawaii so I 'm sure someone is enjoying it too . We like it for it 's small size and wonderful optics . Easy to adjust too .
  I work in technical support for small and large format printers . This has been a great tool kit . It is in a nice compact case that I can lock away in my file cabinet . And so far has had all the tools I need to make repairs .
  This is a relatively inexpensive IP camera that works relatively well in the wired mode that is relatively new to the market . However , even with extensive help from Linksys / Cisco 's technical service I have been unable to get it to function in the wireless mode . As others have noted the color is poor . Read more .. Pros - This is an affordable IP camera that allows one to view from other computers if you use Linksys ' web-forwarding service or other services . - Pan / Tilt mechanism works though , as another reviewer points out , a little noisy . This may be good if you want to know if someone is using the camera . - There is a 2X zoom that may help is some cases but it is not much of a magnification - The color of the image suggests that it relies heavily on IR wavelengths so it may work in low light but I have not tried this yet . - There is an LCD panel on the front that allows one to check the unit 's IP address and whether it is static or dynamic . - The software permits an email alert if the image changes which functions as motion detector . - The software can ftp an still image to another site at regular intervals so that you can build a movie or update a viewing web page . - Setting up the camera in wired mode was straightforward . Cons - As others have noted the color is poor . Trees and grass register a reddish hue that suggests that the camera is heavily weighted toward the IR wavelengths . A replacement unit also had this problem so it is probably the default situation . - The image resolution is not crisp . - As another reviewer has noted the stand is flimsy and does not hold the camera securely , especially if the cable is stiff . - The major problem is that I have not been able to establish a wireless connection using my D-Link DI-642 wireless router . This has been noted by other reviewers . After with several interactions with Linksys / Cisco 's technical service the first unit was deemed defective and replaced ( shipping at my expense ) . The replacement unit also could not function wirelessly suggesting that the problems are inherent in the design . I will not list the steps that we tried to establish WiFi but they were extensive with both the initial unit and the replacement unit . Linksys / Cisco has again asked me to send the replacement unit in for another replacement . I am fairly proficient with wireless configurations so I should be able to configure this camera to work with my network . In summary , this camera has good potential but is plagued by problems that make it a disappointing product . I believe that this camera has a narrow window of compatibility and is not ready for the general consumer market . I 'm betting that these problems result from software issues that were not addressed before rollout . I can not recommend this camera . Please note that it is Linksys / Cisco 's policy that no refunds are given on returned equipment . This means that if you are not satisfied with its performance you have no recourse .
  Love these little cameras . Easy smeezy to setup and use . Great reception . Bought one 6 months ago for a laptap .. loved it so much , just bought another from my PC .
  I bought three of these so we can show off our new baby to her grandparents via skype . 1 . They are quite blurry . It 's fine if you 're sitting still and talking , but after any kind of motion the picture will be very bad for around a second . 2 . One grandparent , on Windows XP , managed to install the drivers that came with the CD instead of downloading the most current ones . As a result , she was sending terrible static bursts every few seconds . Upgrading the driver fixed the issue , but it took an hour of painful over-the-phone debugging to discover that this was the problem . 3 . We often have trouble with the audio cutting out . Probably this is a bandwidth problem , but we all have " good " internet service ( cable modems or fiber ) . If I had it to do over again , I would pay some extra to buy something better .
  I was in the market for headphones to serve my music needs in an open-plan office environment . My requirements were 1 ) quality sound , 2 ) comfort , 3 ) minimal sound leakage . This set basically fits the bill perfectly . I wear headphones almost every day to block out the office noise ( I 'm a developer ) . They are comfortable on my head for up to 4 hours straight ( the longest I 've gone ) , the sound quality is excellent , and finally my coworkers aren't complaining about my music bleeding out . I highly recommend !
  The company that made the product is now defunct . I was never able to get my printer to work . It came with a cable that did not work . I bought an IR device that never made a connection and then after contacting the seller , I bought the cable they said to buy . It still does not work .
  This comfortable and slightly portable headphones carry a fantastic sound that makes me find new details in the music that I 've never heard before . You could say that it does not block surrounding noise well and there is noticeable sound leakage , but I see them as sacrifices in order to grant the best sound possible for an under-$100 set .
  Works amazingly well for the low price point . My Phenom 's cores haven't ever gone past 150ish , even with a full load . And that 's using the standard heatsink-fan combo provided by AMD . More than enough for numerous applications , too ! Awesome Product !
  While these are very stylish , with the silver / black metal buds and plug , andthe piece that keeps the cords from separating .. and they DO form a nice seal , blocking out ambient noise nicely , and do have nice bass .. where is the treble ? The whole idea of spending a bit more , for me anyway , was to get a better , more realistic reproduction of the sounds I wanted to hear .. But while you get the bass , which is IMPORTANT , it is at the sacrifice of the higher end of the range . There is either a serious variation in quality from set to set , or else some of the reviewers simply are not audiophiles , and are not aware of what is missing . I will be contacting Amazon to ask for a refund , and my search continues .
  did not fit the camera i had in mind , always double check the models listed with the model you 're intending it for use ! seems like a fine battery physically ..
  I purchased the Sentry HO2.1 headphones a week ago . Beside the fact that it requires batteries to work , they seem like a great deal . The problem : The set that I have are picking-up radio interference . As soon as I turn it on and plug into a device I can hear the same radio station clear as a bell . The strange thing is I don't even have to plug it into a device ; I can just touch the metal contact of the cord to most large metal objects in the house and listen to this one radio station ! I think its some manufacturing defect causing these headphones to behave as a simple bandpass filter and since it has its own power source it just amplifies the interference . Regardless of the cause , it is an extremely annoying problem since no mater what I 'm listening to there is always faint gospel music playing in the background ! Folks I kid you not . I am willing to accept that this is a defect only in the pair that I have , though I would not bet on it .
  if you have an iPod mini , or a 4G or up iPod , then you will be wondering , Why should i get this ? well , you shouldnt because this product is mainly made for 3G iPods , becasue the third generation iPod doesnt charge via USB , for it does the exact opposite , sucks the life out of your iPod . this lets you do what all the latest iPods can do , if you are a windows user , charges your iPod while conected to your computer . the only users who whould need this is for people with an unpowered usb port , for the latest iPods .
  I rated this 5 stars based on its utility for my laptop . The device itself is quite compact , appears to be sturdily built , and is easy to use . I have Windows XP and after plugging it into a usb port it was recognized immediately and ready to play . The sound quality is mainly midrange - unlike another reviewer I did not hear deep base , and nor is the treble very extended . But the sound is clear , it plays at sufficient loudness , and it sounds WAY better than a normal laptop speaker . This isn't audiophile-grade hi-fi sound , but it is very decent sound in a nicely built , attractive and easily transportable package . It also comes with software to adjust the sound but I haven't installed this ; it sounds fine without it . Definitely a big improvement over built-in laptop speakers .
  I think it 's more than said , that this is the best complete mp3 player with most compatible options there is in the market , its worth every buck !
  I just installed one of these for a friend and in the instructions Brother tells you that you must use the cartridge before the expiration date on the cartridge package or six months after you place it into the machine . This means that if the machine has been on the store 's shelf for a while your will have to replace the cartridge before it is empty . This also means that you should not purchase additional cartridges so that you can quickly replace the cartridge when it is empty because your backup cartridge also has at least the same expiration date . I would not buy this for anyone that might run into this cartridge expiration issue during a crisis such as getting out a term paper for college or a business offer or presentation at the last minute . You know how things go - it will expire exactly when you need it the most ! I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT ..
  I was worried the battery would only last a short time but it 's been a month and it 's still going strong .
  This is the second one of these I bought and I 've had no problems with either one of them . I get great picture and sound .
  Purchased this item to survey a remote lake . Interested in bottom morphology and structure more than fish . Worked very well . As stated in the specs , you must use at slow speeds . Over 5mph it loses the bottom and gives strange readings . But below 5mph gives very good and accurate bottom and structure readings with decent detail for an inexpensive and portable system . Would prefer a much smaller / lighter weight battery option than the sealed lead acid battery . Otherwise met all expectations and needs .
  Isolation is good , though minor strange noises may occur due to the deformation of the ear bud . The frequency characteristics seems to be not so good at first , yet becomes better after working several days . The space and position feelings are excellent .
  I purchased these headphones 6 months ago . For the first three months I was pretty happy with them . Great sound quality , they really reduced outside noise on noisy bus rides I take , and they were light and easy to carry . However , while taking them off my head , they broke . The plastic piece holding the earphone simply snapped . I wasn't too rough with them or anything . Reading the warranty more closely , I discovered it said " Invalid in the United States and Canada . " This is a European company so apparently the product is not warranted in the US.I am going to try sending them back to a service center here in the states , but I would never buy these headphones again . They are too cheaply made . If you spend $ 50 , your headphones shouldn't break .
  This is a great device the software to use it sucks . The software in the zune is great but the software you install on your computer is terrible . Which makes me wonder why create a bad software when you all ready have a good one . Instead of using Windows music player and make a simple patch to make it work for the Zune they created a frustrating and hard software to use . I recommend the zune to tech savvy people only if you don't know how to do much on a computer you will have trouble
  I bought this product for my 6 years old kid , it work for a month . After that , the battery lost its charge and did not get charged . The AC adaptor wont work , the battery not charge , for that reason a portable DVD is not longer portable . Toys R us is responsible for offering a product from a company that does not have any quality control and released a faulty product . Also Toys R us did not take any responsibility for selling this product . I will not buy any other electrical device at Toys R us . In Puerto Rico we always say " Cheap things are dearest "
  I have had such a lousy experiance with this machine . I have burnt about 2 cds and wasted atleast 30 other cds trying to get this machine to burn . It takes forever to burn and then when it is almost done it just says there is an error and you 've wasted 20 minutes on a cd that didn't burn and is not usable . I went through customer service and customer support and they kept telling me to do the same things that they told me to do the time before when I went for help . Save your money and buy a different brand . I have lost all faith in HP products as of now .
  From a software standpoint this device is a marvel . Especially with the firmware update 1.12fp , allowing one to pickup where you were when you turned the unit off . One quibble with the software even there though is that you have to choose whether to play an uncompressed audio ( wav ) file CD OR a compressed data ( mp3or wma ) file CD . You cannot play a CD with mixed audio and data files . However , my biggest quibble is with the hardware design . The way I see it if you are at home there is no need to use the device because you can use your computer to play files . This leaves either in the car or outside . They warn you for safety reasons not to use the player in the car . And , as has been pointed out by others , if you are even walking , the skip protection is useless ! So from a practical standpoint , the only way to get use out of this device is to buy a car adapter to use in your auto . I 'll wait until they provide 1 ) Much better skip protection and 2 ) an auto adapter which comes with the unit . Providing a belt holder on the case is inane or worse ! Who would continuously stand still to listen to files ?
  Sounds great but will not last more then a few weeks . I have ben through 3 pairs of these and each pair the right ear bud has gone out and then they sound like trash . Waste of money .
  As of the day I bought this , early February , 2010 , the Amazon blurb said " The Back-UPS CS provides professional-grade power protection for office and home office systems . " and " These features along with its classic styling make the Back-UPS CS a perfect choice for protecting your important office and home office systems . " Lulled by this assurance , I did not realize that 230V is not just a harmless part of the name like BK500 or 500VA or even 300W . So I ordered and upon delivery found reference in the literature to " Valid in Australia only " . What ? They have 240 Volt power . I am in the US ! So right before wrecking my computer , I checked again . To my surprise , some companies use 220 to 260 volt office equipment in North America and some ship to foreign subsidiaries . So " 230 volt " is sold for use here and for export , but average Amazon customers here should be EXPLICITLY WARNED and not misled . Back it goes and the vendor charges a restocking fee plus I pay shipping both ways . Oh , the joy of buying on the internet . Pitfalls abound , even with legitimate retailers . It 's easy to say " You should have known that 230V means 240 volts before you bought it . " Well , it did not occur to me at the time and I am annoyed by the careless , deceptive blurb . This product is not made for North American home office systems . Amazon 's description is wrong and misleading . At least I did not destroy my computer . Thank you for nothing , Amazon !
  Microphone is better than average , volume and balance of audio quality is good for the money . Comfortable for longer use . I 'd recommend it .
  Well almost a year later I guess this has done its job . For those with a standard 15.4 " screen , I would probably recommend something else . I thought it would stretch , as other reviewers had mentioned , but I ended up with small holes in the two bottom corners . It has protected the outside of the computer , but it is a struggle every day getting it in . It was inexpensive , but I still have to drop it from my original 4 stars to 3 stars . - The major draw to this item was the price , $ 14.99 . It is a bit tight on my Dell computer , but it serves the purpose - protecting it while it is in my backpack . I will say that after reading a previous reviewers comments on the metal bodyglove logo scrating the top of his laptop , I do place the computer in the sleeve upside down .
  Glad I ordered this one ! After reading the reviews , I was not certain about re-purchasing . We decided to rely on our own history of owing the same model for 11 years , which we were very happy with . We have had it for 2 months now without any problems . It arrived in perfect condition . Improvements to the buttons are great ! We made the decision to go with the larger oven again because the size is there if you need it . We haven't used the sensor because we know the settings we want . The heating is even and gentle enough on the lower settings to warm refrigerated bread dough perfectly . There are enough settings to get exactly what you want . An excellent value ! Thank you Panasonic and Amazon !
  I 've been a trackball user for over 5 years now . The last one I had was Kensington 's one with the big clear blue ball . It lasted a good 4 years before the lil rubber rollers gave out . So I decided to replace it with an optical trackball . I chose this one because it had the same layout and left / right click capabilities as my previous one . I am pretty pleased with it . I am amazed at how little I have to work to move the ball .. I never realized how much effort I needed to move the old non-optical one . There are only a few design issues I wish I could fix . 1 ) My old one you could turn the whole thing upside down and the ball wouldn't fall out . On this model the ball has no locking-in device . I use this with my laptop and have to search for the ball at the bottom of my bag every single time . 2 ) The lil indent the optical lense is sitting in is a prime place for dust and crap to settle , disrupting the performance . They should cover it up and make it flush with the rest of the interior . 3 ) I wish the buttons were moved a lil more towards the front . It 's the fine for clicking with your thumb .. but a lil too far back to click on the otherside with your pinky or ring finger .
  I purchased this as well as two other sizes . They work great for keeping all my family portrait pictures in one place .
  i bought a laptop from advantage and it is not what i expected . the external drive is broke and its beat up . i was told by eugene if i remove the bad feedback he would have it replaced . i assumed by the way he was emailing me that i was to get the replacement the same day i give the broken one to ups . i called this morning to get the tracking number and i got the rudest man ever on the phone . all i wanted was the tracking number and he accused me that i was going to put a rock in the box and return it and that i was NOT going to get a replacement immediately like i assumed by what eugene had made it sound . this has me very upset and i will not be doing business with advantage computers in the future . jeanne wrann
  I bought these headphones to replace two sets of the same make and model . They fit my 5 and 6 year old very well , they are easy to adjust the volume . The two sets I was replacing have made it through two vehicles and they finally had been stepped on and broken but they still worked if you put them on
  After having this unit for two years we are cancelling our Dish service . The DVR would often skip recording events . Then it would stop recording things we had scheduled to record ads that Dish had forced onto the system . It also didn't record complete episodes . I can't tell you how often I missed the last 20 minutes of major shows because the DVR didn't record correctly . Avoid this unit and don't subscribe to Dish-they weren't helpful , they raised rates without informing subscribers , and they tried to force me to not cancel . It took two hours with six different Dish reps to finally get it cancelled . DirecTV is much better .
  The cartridge was obviously leaky as soon as I opened the plastic wrapping . Fortunately I was in a position to wash my hands immediately , or I would have been stained for days . So I had to return it , and dealing with Amazon return is no fun . The return process is confusing at best . When I finally got to the part where I could ship via UPS , the program to pull up a list of local stations wasn't working . I will buy it locally from now on . At least then if there are problems I know where to go .
  I had the " opportunity " to view this player at one of BB 's Magnolia stores . It was connected via HDMI to a high-end Sony 1080p RPTV , playing a Blu-Ray demo disc . The first thing I noticed was an unexpected fuzziness and graininess to the image . Since it was a movie clip I just thought , " well , OK .. I guess it 's normal for film to have grain , right ? " However , as the disc progressed into a chapter of digital still pictures ( presumably to demonstrate the steadiness of the image ) , I was even less impressed . I watched , somewhat off-put , as a centuries-old book panned jerkily onto the screen . Once the panning finally stopped , the richly calligraphed pages of the open book could easily be read ( albeit with noticeable ghosting around the letters ) . But then , when an ancient style world map appeared on the screen , I literally winced . The violent vibration from the closely spaced lines reminded me of a flickering 1980 's computer monitor running 1024x768 at 60Hz . A whole section of the map was shimmering , and not in a good way . I couldn't watch any more , and I walked out of the store with a headache I didn't have when I entered . If Sony 's own demo of their Blu-Ray player is this bad , they can keep it .
  I purchased my 30gb iPod a little under a month ago and have used it extensively ever since . Over the short , but generous time I 've interacted with my iPod , I 've come to notice things I love about it , and some things that irk me , but in the long run , don't take away the value that this iPod holds . Pros : - Navigation is very easy . Menus are available with a flick of the finger and there 's a place for everything and everything is in it 's place . - Storage . With 30gb , I can hold about 7,500 songs . Imagine , hundreds of compact discs stored all in one , small machine . - When I ordered my 30gb video iPod , I was worried about the size . For some reason , I remember it being fairly large [ which it never was , just my imagination ] , so when I actually received it , I was stunned . It 's large enough that photos and videos are good for viewing , but it 's slim and portable enough to slip into your pocket . - Someway , somehow Apple created brilliance in the sync relationship these iPods holds with iTunes . I can't explain , it just does . It does . Upload a CD , a couple songs , whatever and plug your iPod in , and it 's on it . - On topic with iTunes , I love how simple it is to create playlists , several for that matter . - There are many singular features that I take pleasure from my iPod with . * The quality of pictures is surprisingly clear for such a small device . Don't let the size fool you now . It 's slim but does it 's job and a good one at that . * The backlight on the screen is nice and bright and can be set to turn of after various increments of time . * I found the chrome back of the iPod to be an easy , on the run mirror . I 'm sure we females would enjoy that more so . * The look itself is well known throughout the world . Slim , sleek and classy . * I love the fact that I can play games , most times while listening to my music . And being able to purchase other games via iTunes is great . Those games entertain me greatly . Of course , there 's always two sides to most things . And , lo and behold , there are some cons to such a product . Cons : -I found the battery life to be my main one . After reading it can last up to 14 hours and only getting about 4 hours max out of mine , I was a bit dejected but after reading into it more , I realized that is because I do active things on my player such as games and photos . Basically , I guess that 's to be expected . - While this isn't necessarily a ' con ' as much as it is wishful thinking , I really hoped there would be a sleep timer as I find those especially useful . -I dislike the fact that the only way to charge it is through a computer , unless you pay for an adapter , which I haven't just yet and the fact that one isn't included . - Speaking of connecting to the computer , it doesn't recognize my iPod half the time . When I go to disconnect it , my iTunes freezes and my computer won't eject it . I 'm not sure if this is my computer , the player , or both . - On a similar note , my player sometimes gets a mind of it 's own . While it 's pretty much always cooperative , if it 's on a low battery , it takes a while to turn on and when connecting to my computer , it shows various screens and takes about 10 minutes to actually return to normal . - As for scratches , I 've really had none , so far . I would still advise you to invest in a case , as the one included is nothing more than a default one . One thing my iPod is prone to is fingerprints . Those little devils like to stick . Seeing as that 's not anything major and can be corrected with a case , I let it pass . As many cons as it may look like I 've written , I still enjoy my iPod very much and think I made a wise investment . The mechanical glitches I 've encountered don't take away from my iPod , just make it , well , a little more interesting at times . I wouldn't trade it for the world . An iPod essentially is for music . It 's got that and beyond , and that is why I have found it to be wonderful .
  I was not sure if I would like this camera when first purchasing , but after receiving and using it , I have only one compliant . The camera does not show or have a battery usage indicator in the display . Other than that it works fine . Takes nice pictures and the wide angle lens comes in handy when shooting those group pictures and getting everyone in the frame . For those who are thinking of buying a digital camera , this camera with 7.1MP is more than enough to enlarge pictures to 8x10 size , and will meet most of your everyday shooting needs , and it less expensive than some of the larger MP types on the market today .
  Despite advertised claims , I was unable to obtain drivers that would work on my Windows 7/64 laptop . Trendnet support was awful . I 've included quotes from two emails from ' tech support ' . Their initial response was " We just tested the installation on a Win7 64 system and had no issues using the CD that came with the unit . " . When I asked for more detail to try to resolve it they replied " Unfortunately , we cannot troubleshoot you computer or OS . " That was the final reply . I tried the CD , downloaded drivers from Trendnet and from Prolific . The hardware itself was not defective ( tested it on XP sp3 ) . It and the drivers might work on some W7/64 machines ( per earlier reviews ) but not on all . I was fortunate in buying it through Amazon . The return / refund is already in process . I gave it 2 stars instead of 0 because it did work well on XP - just not on W7/64 .
  Doesn't work tried it on three different tv 's and got weerd lines with all resolutions tried interlaced and progressive scan .
  I 've been spending time seriously researching which LCD HDTV I 'm going to buy . My choices are between the Sony 26S2000 , Panasonic 26LX600 , Samsung LN-S2641D , Sharp 26SH20U and Toshiba 26HL66 . I 'm a Sony fan , owned several of their TVs over the years and been pretty happy . I was leaning that way again - my last TV was a wonderful 23 " Sony LCD HDTV that I gave to a close friend because she didn't have a TV and I wanted a slightly larger model with HDMI anyway . I know most people now pass over the 26 " and go for the 32 " but the smaller size suits my small living room which I don't want to make a screening room ! However the recent Consumer Reports ( that I personally respect a lot in the absence of any other thorough independent comparative study I can get my hands on ) on the new crop of LCD HDTVs put my Sony preference on hold because the Toshiba is TOP RATED in both the 26 " and 32 " categories . I spent some time looking at these models over the weekend and my decision is almost made . The Toshiba picture looks great - better than the Sony ( though it 's hard to tell in a TV store where everything is on an HD feed ) . So with Consumer Reports ratings and analysis placing the Toshiba ahead by 3 points overall , actual design and price comes more into play - and I have to hand it to the Toshiba ! The Sony looks pretty dull and a bit too plastic ( I know they all are made of the stuff ! ) whereas the Toshiba ironically looks pretty cool because it seems to have taken it 's styling cues from Sony 's highly desirable XBR line ! BTWI didn't include the XBR in my quest because it 's much more than I can afford - though of course I lust after it . But for some $ 300 less , the Toshiba may well prove to be an excellent top rated XBR substitute . In fact it 's the least expensive of all the other models I mentioned in this review .
  Sound was great but did not last any longer than cheep ear plugs . The wire connection cut out after only a few weeks of using .
  The Yamaha RX-497 AM / FM Stereo Receiver is an elegant piece of electronics . It produces high fidelity sound with lots of power . The front panel is intuitive and easy to use . The FM antenna is better than some add-on antennas I 'd purchased previously . In addition to the radio , I count seven auxiliary inputs on the back ( including XM radio ) and two sets of speaker jacks so the amplifier has lots of flexibility . Remember to check the dimensions , the receiver is big .
  I have been very happy with this headset . It is lightweight , comfortable , and sounds great . Excellent value for the price .
  I don't know if I got a bad one , but it can't receive the weather radio signal without an external antenna , and I live in the middle of a large city . It is a disappointment .
  Installs easy and is very easy to use . It prints crisp , clear documents and pictures . The seperate ink units are a plus . The only downfall is the noisy paper advance .
  This is the second set of these speakers I have purchased . These ones are going to be a gift . I 've searched around for travel speakers and these guys are the best buy around : for under $ 20 you get 10 watts of power , adjustable bass and treble that actually works , and a very decent amount of sound . If you 're looking for speakers that stay at home , the JBL Creatures are another good buy at about $ 83 .
  Use Canon ink with you Canon printer and you 'll have no problems , just excellent pictures .
  The manual feed is a pain , it 's one paper feed at a time and it difficult to feed the paper since it 's not a try but a slot - I am also having difficulty printer to tray two , for some reason it keep referring to manual feed even if everything is set to print from ( auto feed or even tray 2 ) . I have three in the office and I will no purchase another one just for this reason .
  A nice looking unit , sounds fine , even has good stereo imaging if you are sitting within three feet of the unit , as reccommended in the manual . But the remote would do absolutely nothing towards controlling my Ipod . It would not change songs , forwards or back , would not pause , and did not turn the Ipod off when it turned off the iM600 . Nothing in the manual addressed whether or not the remote was intended to do these functions . But if not , why would they refer to it as a full-function remote ? Is that why they say to sit within three feet , to reach the Ipod ? I returned it to Future Shop the next day .
  I found this camera to be a great investment . The quality of the pictures is impeccable . You have 10 megapixels at your disposal . I purchased the 4 gig stick for the camera and I am able to record somewhere around an hour 's worth of video and you still have room for pictures . The camera creates a slideshow with optional music in the background . Pretty sweet . The only setback that the camera has is a steady cam feature to help eliminate blurry pictures . You have to hold the camera fairly still to capture a good photo . The software is fairly simple as well . For $ 350 , you get a touch screen ( the screen is huge I might add .. ) camera that takes amazing quality photos . Go for it !
  Hello . I recieved the product on time . Was in good condition . Work great . Good price . Thank you .
  This being my first wireless kb / mouse set , I 'm presuming maybetoo much by assuming that this sort of behavior does not occur inthe other main technology ( believe it 's RF wireless ) that isused .. I would think by now that any kinks that may have been in a priorgeneration of bluetooth devices would no longer be an issue inthis one ( response time , connection , battery life ) , butunfortunately , this set has all those issues and more . At first , the keyboard was ok , but I had numerous occasions wherethe mouse would lose connection , sometimes for more than a fewminutes . Nothing I did would fix the issue ( like attempting amanual reconnect ) . Almost on cue , if I used the mouse for about4-5 hrs straight , it would seem to lose connection due toinadequate charging . The keyboard is mainly for looks IMO , the lcd display is moreof a gimmick than anything else . But the keyboard did have alot of nice programmable keyboard shortcuts , although I tendedto accidentally hit the mute button on the lower left a lot . But now , after only 1 1/2 weeks of usage , the keyboard batteriesare already drained to the point where I have keypresses repeatthemselves . I tried using rechargeables , but I have to almostchange them out everyday . You 'll know when the keyboard batteriesstart being inadequate when you keypress and then you get 4-8repeats of the same key . I don't know if I 'm expecting too much out of this wireless setsince this is my first wireless set and I do tend to use thecomputer for at least 6 hrs a day . I don't believe it 's adefective product . But I did not expect it to be this bad , especially with one of the newer generations of bluetoothequipment . Again , I 'm assuming it 's mainly the bluetooth . I havenot seen similar issues with the RF sets that my friends use . My last comment - I ended up putting the bluetooth usb dongleon the front of my computer , which seemed to improve theconnection to the mouse . However , after doing that , any time Itry connecting other usb devices to the 2nd usb port on thefront , the computer no longer recognizes the device . Somehow , the bluetooth device either screwed the usb port up , or maybeis draining more than a usual amount of power ? Anyhow , I would highly recommend anything else out thereunless you want a very elegant , compact , and troublesome wirelesskb / mouse combo .
  This is the first " Real Quality " subwoofer I 've owned . It replaces a Bose unit which I bought on sale some years back . All I can say is WoW ! Any cheap sub will crack the windows if turned up high enough . But if you want something with a smooth tight bass that augments your music and seems to disapear , then this is one of them . Of any piece of audio equipment , a subwoofer is in actualality a " musical instrument " . Speakers , in general , are made to reproduce the full audio spectrum which are made up of multiple instruments . But a subwoofer is dedicated to the lower seqment ( somewhere from about 120Hz and lower ) . The Mirage OMNIS8 does this with class . And if called upon , it will rock the foundation with the opening scene from " Star Wars " .
  This printer has been an absolute nightmare . We wanted an all in one so we wouldn't have so many machines in our office . Well when you try to print something it stops halfway and you can't get it to finish printing without shutting down your pc and the printer and rebooting everything . This might work if you 're lucky . We 've called HP several times to no avail . They seem to have no idea what the problem is because they 've had us try all sorts of nonsence that doesn't work . They were absolutely no help . I could get a realiable printer for the fraction of the cost and that 's what I intend to do . We 've stuck with this printer for so long because of the cost , but I just can't take it anymore .
  DONT BUY MAGELLAN ! Totally unreliable , died when I needed it during a trip in Florida . The Call support center has been outsourced to the Phillipines ! I had to send the dead unit to Texas . They have had it for almost one month , cannot fix it and do not have a replacement to ship to me . So I continue to wait in limbo . Will never buy a Magellan again or recommend it to anyone .
  I routinely buy Sony sound product for their crispness , these are no exception . They stay on while running into the wind and sound great .
  What can you say about Tri-X ? It 's fast , it 's grainy , and it 's one of only two reversal films produced by Kodak for the Super 8mm format . And now it 's available on Amazon at a not-unreasonable price . Huzzah ! And contrary to what another reviewer claimed , there are many labs that are able to process this film . Google " CineLab " , " Spectra Film and Video " , " Pro8mm " , and " Yale Film and Video " for just a few examples .
  External hard drives can be so delicate and it 's important to my peace of mind to spend a little bit more to protect it even if it spends its entire life in a desk drawer and rarely travels ( we 'll see ! ) . This case is good durable quality which is not too soft at all and I trust it with my data . The magenta is a chill color .. something to be said for adding a dash of personality to a pretty standard thing . Fits the Toshiba 320GB HDDR320E04XW nicely with no complaints . All my drive needs is one little USB cord so it fits snug in case 's mesh pocket . Happy stuff .
  I was very excited about this product after reading all the online hype . Sadly this docking station is not quite as it seems . As a good example of planning not meeting execution , the idea and design are great , but the construction and quality are not . Here are some of my observations : Pros : - Great idea to pipe video to a widescreen TV-even a better idea to see song lists and titles on the large screen . Navigation via the included remote / on screen menus is as easy as operating an iPod . - Great overall ` look ' of the docking station , cool looking black and shiny remote with rubber backing . This setup was obviously designed with black iPods and Nanos in mind and matches them well . - Separate RCA jacks for L and R audio ( versus headphone audio jacks ) make the unit appear like a genuine stereo component . - S-Video support for video-out . Cons : - Price is steep - ` Just OK ' sound quality that is tonally in the middle of the spectrum ( i.e. no pronounced bass or highs ) . Even with premium cables ( not the cheap ones supplied in the box ) , a high-end receiver will highlight the mediocre sound quality . - Poor overall ` feel ' of the docking station . It is light , thinly built , hollow , and feels as ` plasticky ' as any sub-$20 , low-end Chinese-made piece of electronics . It 's light . The weight of my Monster audio / S-video cables pull the unit back towards my cabinet . Only my 60GB iPod itself makes a good ballast to counter the weight of the cables . - Remote control buttons are not sensitive and require multiple presses at times to work . Again , this is typical of cheap Chinese electronics . - Poor manufacturing quality and control-there are odd , thin cut marks along the remote control 's hole punch-outs . It is obvious these marks are machine made . - On screen display layout / fonts are far from sexy . They remind me of the graphic quality of a 1980 's , 16-color Apple II computer . ( Is this some sort of Apple retro statement by DLO ? ) - The unit gets very hot to the touch when charging an iPod . Obviously the bad quality control and construction extends to its internal circuit boards . This was very disconcerting to me as I feared damaging my prized iPod , and is the main reason why I returned the item . Bottom line : The box cover says it best when displaying the song , " Never Satisfied " on its mock TV print layout . Sadly , most owners will not be satisfied until DLO gets it quality control issues worked out . Now where do I find a good iPod stereo dock ?
  Same as everyone .. pain in the butt to install . It managed to disable my wireless rather connecting it .. The tech support guy , clearly reading a computer screen somewhere in India , was clueless , a jerk on top of it , and rude .. Finally after getting it connected , it now drops the connection repeatedly just as advertised in the other reviews .. I should have listened ..
  I ordered this speaker because I don't have much room about my TV and my THX center channel is way to large to fit in the space . The speaker does a good job all around .. no complaints .. I guess my only wish was it was 4 ohms not 8 .. but all the new receivers ( at least the higher end ones ) have a microphone you place in the room and it calibrates the speakers .. so my 8ohm center ( this speaker ) gets adjusted so it matches the others .
  This a fantastic equipment for those who love serius photography . I recomend this products 100 %
  The carrying case was a little smaller then I expected but other then that it 's fine . It was well worth the cost .
  Great keyboard and mouse . I 've had them for 3 years and they work like a charm . I use them everyday and I haven't had any issues . Batteries lasts about 5 months . Windows 7 automatically recognizes them so I don't have to be running extra software .
  I purchased this router for a relative of mine . I recently opened the package to find that I received a USED router . There were scratches on the top of the router and the " install the software first warning sticker " that normally is covering the ports was off and stuck to the inside of the product literature . Someone also had scribbled on the product literature with a black permanent marker . I am not happy about this . I expect more from Amazon and Linksys . I 'm guessing I received a return , refurb , or something along those lines . A new item does not look like this . This is the second time in a few months this has happened to me with a purchase coming directly from Amazon . The first issue was with a computer subwoofer from Logitech that had a large scuff mark on the top of it . My guess is someone was resting their shoes on it . It is very noticeable .
  DON'T BUY ANY ZUNE / MICROSOFT PRODUCT ! I 'm still looking at a blank Zune screen and a worthless device because Microsoft refuses to admit there is a problem with Zune as of 12/31/08 . Don't trust Microsoft , and don't buy Zune unless you just want to throw your money away ! I 've never been a Mac person , but now it 's time to change !
  Really amazing camera . If you are looking to buy HD type camera for your skype - this is it ! Make sure you have powerful computer and fast internet !
  Be carefull . Amazon sent me a PC10016X64SODIMM , currently a generic module from Viking instead of the announced C01063 module type . What Amazon is selling does NOT work on compaq Presario 1200 series notebooks !
  What a nightmare . I 'm going to declare it a national holiday when I return this item . Do a Google search online before you buy this item . You will see endless calls for help over missing drivers , challenges with installing software using XP , etc . I have considerable computer experience . Yet after I bought this All-in-One unit last weekend I spent 14 hours on the phone w / HP tech support and endless hours trying fixes of my own . They all gave me a different story . Then turned me over to the laptop division of HP saying it must be a problem w / my laptop . The laptop division , SURPRISE , sent me back to the printer division . I 've tried all the ' fixes ' , ordered a new installation disk , reintalled software many times , new USB cable . Nadda . Still junk . Save yourself the frustration . I am keeping my old ' print only ' printer . It 's plug and play . If you have Windows XP Professional , this unit will NOT necessarily be ' Plug and Play . ' Time to go give my old reliable printer a hug . The software , by the way , is a complete memory hog and takes forever to install .
  I took this out of the box and within minutes ( no exaggeration ) had a picture scanned , saved and posted on my web site-very easy to use-no power cord , the USB does it all . GREAT PRODUCT !
  We use this to provide wi-fi in our home to our PC laptop , two iPhones , and our iPad and to network everything back to our PC desktop . Works great . For the price you can't go wrong .
  It works in my Sony DSC-S85 camera , but not in my Sony camcorder . It gives a format error . I 'm not sure why the difference because it works fine in the camera . If I would have known that it would work only in the camera , I would have purchased the Sony Stick .
  I purchased this card in 12/01 . After a very quirky install , the card worked well for 4 months and then went dead . It took numerous phone calls to get an RA . It then took Creative 4 months to return the card , which still didn't work . A few more phone calls and a new card arrived . After working for 3 months , died . I marked the card and returned for repair / replacement . After 4 months I received the same card back , not working . I was then sent a 5.1 card that I couldn't hook-up to the front panel . I am now junking this card and trying a new product . Will never use a Creative product again . I could excuse the problems , but not the shameful lack of customer support and service .
  Fell apart after first use . The soft part of the earpiece broke away from the hard plastic . Had to toss them . not word $ 15:99 il buy a diffrent one
  I decided to get this 80GB iPod in order to store my CD collection . It seems that I will never run out of space in this iPod . The only problem I 've had so far is that sometimes it stops working for 3 up to 10 seconds , and then it starts working again . This only happens when turning the wheel around and when plugged into the monster cable in the car . I 'm pretty satisfied , though .
  WOW ! Are these really supposed to be less than 40 bucks ? The sound is amazingly full , from classical to jazz to rock . Playing Elgar 's Enigma Variation I could hear the distinct sound of each instrument , from the treble to bass , nothing but clean crisp sound . Chopin 's piano was nothing short of heaven on these headphones . Playing some jazz saxophone , I could hear the player breath ! I have never heard that in this track when I was listening to it all the previous times . Also , you can heard where each note begins and ends , even when the sax part was soft and blanketed by the accompanyment . Moving over to my favorite rock bands , again , deep bass and crisp sound . In summary , unless you want to spend 150 + bucks on some closed and bulky headphones , you won't be able to find anything better than these headphones . And if your budget is under 50 , I don't see how you can choose any other headphone .
  I bought this cable to connect my Playstation 3 to an HDTV set that has only DVI ( I think it 's DVI-I ) but no HDMI . This cable works beautifully . Image quality is really good . The price just can't be beat . You should be aware that while HDMI carries both audio and video , DVI is video only , so you still need to route the audio to your TV somehow . For example , I use an optical digital audio cable to do that ( together with an expensive converter box as my old HDTV set doesn't have an optical input ) .
  Nice and small , worked great . Dont expect to fit a projector and a 15 " laptop on it though . I would say most projectors and any 12 " laptop would work .
  I love it great product A + + + + + + + + + + + + + +
  I finally decided on the mini because of the size of the player and the fact that music could be stored in files . Three of my family members were going to use it , and we wanted to make sure we could all have our own seperate playlists . Downloading from CD 's was so easy , even I could do it quickly . I really like the " look " of the player as well . Very Cool . The things I noticed that were somewhat lacking is a guard or shield ( you have to remember to hit the " hold " button even when it 's off if you 're going to put it in your purse ) . You can buy one of course , for $ 30 extra . It also doesn't have an " off " button , but turns itself off if not in use . The earphones are ok .. the fuzzy things came off after about 3 days of use . My husband and son like a different kind , and ended up purchasing those instead . The sound is wonderful and the Monster car adapter ( $ 79 ) works great . I kind of wish it had a neck cord like the shuffle , I 'm not a big fan of the arm band ( which is also extra ) . We also have a one outlet hook up to our stereo and can play the mini straight through our speakers . Love the green color , btw .. very fun .
  DYMO Labeling Tape , D1 , Split Back , adhesive , Easy Peel , " x 23 ' , ( 45013 ) , Black Print on White Tape . I purchased this to use with my new Dymo Label-er . It works very well with it . It was shipped very quickly . I am pleased with my purchase .
  I placed my mac in my living room because there is another pc in my room . I decided to buy a cordless desktop to avoid wires running across the living room . I bought this for cheap at another major store . Once installed it was a hassle to setup and after that it became a pain in the arse . The main culprit is very weak signal . The mouse would jitter ; the keyboard would become unresponsive . It would only work nearly well if I 'm at a distance of 2 feet , at most . Do not buy this if you are unable to get this close to the receiver . This is a very poor product . I recommend the Logitech brand ; it works perfectly .
  It looks good in the box but if you like to hit the snooze feature beware . Timex put the snooze bar and alarm off / on right next to each other on top of clock . Ive overslept for a week before I finally trashed this thing .
  I 've been using these headphones for almost two years now , practically every night ! They always sound great and have never caused me any problems ! It 's not really fair to compare these headphones with corded headphones but considering the freedom the RS-85 gives you to roam around without pulling a cord behind you , I think these headphones are a great value ! I strongly recommend the RS-85 to anyone looking for a quality wireless headphones !
  I would have liked to have been able compare the quality of this set to others , but was unable to find them locally . Instead I used the reviews here and elsewhere to come to a purchasing decision . Considering that , I 'm very pleased with these headphones . I bought them primarily for watching TV when walking and running on the treadmill . ( Treadmill is on the porch - neighbor didn't want to listen to my TV ! ) Reception is clear and range is as advertised with little drop out even while outdoors and using the living room TV . My only complaint would be that while very comfortable on my head , they slip forward when I lean over . Some of the other reviewers have noted the same thing . All in all , except for that one flaw , I think they are perfect for my purposes .
  The mouse that was delivered was not the one that is listed in here ! Contact the seller and they keep on avoiding me . Buy from them at your own risk . :(
  These headphones are not very good . Very cheaply made-one ear doesn't work unless you wiggle the cord around . The sound is okay I guess and the volume knobs on the actual headphones are nice for recording music in our home studio but the quality of these headphones is VERY low ..
  A lot of hype for what it is : poorly made and pretty useless .
  Very responsive . Perfect for the feeling of writing with a pen . I us it for all my note applications , several drawing apps as well . Perfect accessory for any touch screen . Love having the option of good ole pen and ink in one compact design when necessary . The clip on the cap is strong I clip it to my pocket book so it is always handy . The length fits my hand very comfortably as well . The white color also compliments my iPad . Perfect !
  Purchased as a gift for my son . Best headphones ever . Can turn off the base boost if needed to reduce power drain .
  After reading all the reviews and high praise that these headphones received , and also after some extensive research ( being sure not to purchase the counterfeit headphones ) , I decided that these were the headphones for me ( the review stating the proper use of these headphones is what sold me ) . Boy was I wrong ! First off , the rubber that covers the wire feels very cheap and thin . It 's not durable and within a couple of uses , will easily start to wear and tear . Not good for functionality ( especially if you use these headphones for anything from walking to exercise ) . Second , the earbuds are not comfortable at all . I tried the smallest earbud covers as I know my ears are small , and couldn't keep them in for long . It was just irritating ( not at all like my sony earbuds ) . These earbuds felt like they were stretching the inside of my ear . Not at all a comfortable feeling . I did manage to get them in deep enough as to hear the sound and not destroy my ear drum at the same time . As for the sound . I 'm not a connoisseur of music and sound but these headphones add no life to the music . The sound is bland , boring , and flat which makes the music loud and annoying ( I mostly listen to rock , but also a wide range of other genres as well ) . I 've even tried switching the different equalizer 's on my MP3 player and it gets no better . The headphones are advertised as to have bass but if that 's what they call bass , then they are sadly mistaken . The bass is nothing more than a boost in the low tones of the music . The high tones are way too loud and you can't even hear the midtones . These headphones are very overrated and sound just like a cheap pair of iPod-like headphones . These headphones definitely aren't the ones for me as I like my music to sound as if it 's alive and these headphones don't do it . Doesn't mean that these aren't the headphones for you . If you like flat and boring sound , then by all means , these would be perfect for you . Or ( for the objective side ) if you like your music loud , these are perfect because they can definitely get loud . And if you 're wondering if I got a counterfeit pair , well then I guess Amazon is selling counterfeits ( not accusing of course , just sarcastically making a point on authenticity of headphones ) because that 's where I got these from . If you do decide that these are for you , I have a pair that have only been used five times to test sound and would be glad to sell them to anyone who wants because I think , no , I 'm sure I 've just wasted 45.00 dollars .
  Pretty much used as an extension plug , but needed it for more outlets . Actually did have a power failure recently and all was fine , no blown fuses or anything . Not using the coaxial component so can't comment on that , but product is great and works just fine !
  I love my Dymo LetraTag label maker so much so of course I need refills for it often ! These labels are awesome ! Make my house all neat and organized , just the way I like it !
  Without exception , this is the WORST PRODUCT I have ever purchased on Amazon . My wife needed these tapes to record an important meeting and the need was so urgent I had them shipped overnight to her hotel for the meeting the next day . After that considerable expense , the tapes were no good . The first one out of the package had a loose end that had come off the reel . I was able to use a small piece of clear tape to re-attach it to the spindle . When she returned home and tried to transcribe the tapes , we found that they were full of drop-outs and sounded like you were rotating the microphone while recording . Her previous tapes were another brand and they worked fine so we know that the recorder is fine . The minimum allowed rating is one star or I would have given it a zero ! Caveat emptor
  I bought this after comparing several speaker systems for my iPod . I really like the the sound on the Altec , especially for its price . I also like having the FM radio built in . BUT .. the unit stopped playing my iPod after about a month .
  My daughter received this for her birthday last year . It seemed perfect for her pink room and light use . It has been 14 months and the bulb is going out . I would recommend buying a brand name television that will last and skip the cutsey . Very dissapointing .
  Here 's my story . I used to have ( note past tense ) pretty much all Linksys gear in my home . Router , switches , print servers , etc . Over a half-dozen devices because our condo is wired like an office with network drops everywhere . All of a sudden in the span of about 6 months , one-by-one most of the devices just died . They had power , but simply would not pass network traffic . I wrote to Linksys and basically said , " Here 's my situation , meet me half-way , do something , anything to keep my business . " They never replied . So I began a quest to look into a new switch for my home office . I decided I wanted a 16 port model because I might max out an 8 port unit . I noticed that the " ProSafe " line from Netgear comes with a lifetime warranty and 24/7 technical support ( although how much support can one need for an auto-sensing switch , assuming it 's actually working . ) So I gravitated toward that line of products . Then looking at the comparison charts I was trying to determine the difference between the mid-level " GS " series and their top of the line " JGS " series switches . There is only one : The JGS models have a built-in power supply . Meaning , no " brick , " just a standard 3-prong power cord . Sold ! My only complaint ( and it is significant ) : The little fan inside this monster is quite noisy . Almost as loud a standard desktop PC , which uses a much larger power supply and fan . Mind you it does not sound " cheap . " It sounds like a quality fan and power supply . It quite simply needs a little better ventilation and Netgear needs to invest that whopping extra 2 bucks on a higher grade fan that it is truly whisper quiet . So in summary , fine for a network closet or an open area with a few people an other things that make modest constant noise , but think about it a bit if it will be in a " quiet " office setting . With quieter operation , it would easily earn 5 stars in my book .
  I think this is a great camera . It takes nice shots and probably even better ones then I have been taking since I have yet to use all of the different modes and features that it comes with . My only real problem with this camera is there isn't a view finder just a screen which is impossible to see if the sunlight hits it . So , you find yourself aiming and shooting and praying you got the shot . Out of direct sun it is great . If they could just add a view finder it would be perfect !
  I just bought this dvd player from costco and it makes alot of noise loading disc . and played only 1 out of 5 disc I tried . Sometimes it would just spin and not do anything and other times it would do nothing when I pressed play . I am returning for another . I hope o just got a bad one
  The price was great . The picture took some time to get just right , but once I did , it was great . A CNET review discussed glare on the screen , but I have not seen this yet . Overall I am very happy .
  Since this was my first time installing a wireless router , I was somewhat nervous if I could do it correctly and easily . Being a computer literate person that I am , I knew that installing the hardware was the easy part . But I was also pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it was setting it up wirelessly with my laptop . I definitely could have used this right out of the box wirelessly with my laptop , but I prefer to have certain security features turned on / off while I am online . And if you don't know what features to turn on / off , you can use the included CD to walk you through it . The size of this wireless router is very small . Its range is also very good for my small apartment . And so far , I haven't experienced any slowdown or loss of connection yet . In conclusion , I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive wireless router with standard features .
  I bought the EX1011 for a xmas present and I have to agree with the review by Dennis Wierzbicki . I was very disappointed to find out you cannot transfer photos from you PC to the frame wirelessly . Kodak wants to control this though the use of their online Gallery which to me is only to sell you other Kodak junk . Some other problems ; I have a network drive and when I try to copy pictures to the Gallery you cannot browse the network . You have to have the photos local or on a lettered drive ( ie C : or D :) . So you have to first copy the photos from your network to somewhere you can upload them to the Gallery . I put photos up in the Gallery and some were in portrait mode and it could not switch them unlike when they are on a memory card , you had to do rotate them manually and then re-upload them to the Gallery . It also allows you to use you PC to host the photos instead of the gallery but you have to use Media Player 11 but who wants to leave their computer on and tied up with Player to show pictures on a Frame ? And the comment about having a default album at startup is correct . It is a very confusing interface . Also it tries to load a lot of crap on you system when you install the software
  I bought this flash-drive for $ 17 ( w / o shipping ) and I am very happy I did so .. because Sony MicroVault has this inbuilt software that compresses many file formats so that it can store more than 2gb . Very fast , and looks cool , and above all , it is a SONY !
  This adapter does NOT fit well with the shuffle - the connection is loose and requires moving the iPOD around to get some level of connection . The connection is bad when you are able to find some connectivity . Don't buy it , unless they make the male portion of the adapter TRULY compatible with the female jack on the Shuffle . This was a waste of money .
  Seems like good quality , and fairly inexpensive . I 'd probably go with the targus UV + Polarizer for $ 20 , though . Silver color doesn't look as bad as I thought it would , but I prefer black .
  Totally worthless . The set screws will not stay in place , using 10 gauge or higher wire , I doubt they 'd even grip 12 gauge . For the record I 'm using this speaker wire : Pyramid RSW12100 12-Gauge 100-Foot Spool of High-Quality Speaker Zip WireThese banana plugs work fine : Sewell Silverback Banana Plugs , Dual Screw Lock , 6 Pair ( 12 Pieces ) Its just a poorly made product .
  This is an excellent card at a terrific price . It works great in my new Canon SD870is .
  I 've had these in my ears for under 10 minutes , and they 've already fallen out three or four times . I should mention that I am sitting in a chair and not moving . Sound quality is sub-par , although for $ 2 I wasn't expecting greatness ( and I 'm sure I would eventually get used to it ) . I was hoping to have these as a cheap backup , but they 're almost unusable . Try something else .
  I didn't think I would be too into the whole Tivo thing when I bought this for my husband , but WOW , it relly does change how you watch tv ! I just wish I would have bought the 80-hr . one , so I wouldn't have to wonder when shows might be deleted to make room for new ones . This one works excellent though , it did stop and reboot a couple times since we had it , but I 'm sure it needed to do so to run properly . Nothing erases when this happens , it just takes about 5 or 6 minutes to start up again , everything is still there when it comes back . Just so you know if you by one , you do have to pay for monthly service and it does need to be connected to a phone line ( I had to run a 50 ft . cord long the ceiling from my kitchen since our living room doesn't have a hookup ) .
  need amplifier or whatever other devices in order to have sound come outso tired of this kind of equipment . copy function is also badthis 100 $ product is even worse than a 20 $ product like sony TCM-150I am sorry I have to say this . However the seller 's service is the best , 5 star .
  I hooked up my PC with my Onkyo HT-RC370 Receiver to transfer the vedio to TV screen . It worked nicely for about 5 days . I did not change resolution and made any modifications , but after about one week , my receiver indicated there was no signal from my PC and the TV screen was blank blue . I rebooted my computer , the Windows logo appeared for couple of seconds on my TV screen , but turn to blank blue screen again when the PC is up running . This problem was not due to my Receiver because when I connected my PC directly with TV , the same thing happened .
  If you find one in good shape - BUY IT ! I bought one locally off Craigslist very cheap , with intention to listen to SACD . I was extremely impressed of sound quality and soon after , I bought a second H / K DVD48 off eBay .. I never found one here .. This is the best SACD played for on budget listeners , without compromising sound quality !
  not a bad price so I bought 3 .. they will make nice Christmas presents for the kids .. should have waited because I found them cheaper elsewhere . for the same exact thing .
  The HP Color LaserJet 3600n is a good buy for the money . You get laser color , speed ( 17 ppm ) , networking . 2 trays all in one machine . If you want great color , don't buy a laser machine , get an inkjet instead . But if you want good color documents printed in a speedy manner for less cost than an inkjet , buy this printer . One of the real benefits of this printer is that it comes with 4 FULL toner cartridges which would normally cost over $ 500 for the cartidges alone ! The toner cartridges are all exposed when you open the cover , making installation very simple . Jams are extremely easy to remove when you have such wide access . By buying this printer , you are getting a lot of bang for your buck !
  I had purchased an earlier 64MB Rio , and loved it . So when I wanted more memory , I naturally tried another Rio . As soon as got my new Rio home , it didn't work . I exchanged it for another , and that one worked for three months , and then the volume button stopped working . If it weren't for these problems , I 'd rate it five stars . The controls are intuitive , and you can figure out everything without reading the manual . The only thin it lacks is the " pants clip " that the earlier Rio 64MB had - that is a lot more comfortable than the belt / arm device the new one has .
  This really sucks . I bought mine at my school . Like two days later it broke off my keys because the handle thing is made of plastic .. which caused me to leave it at the school computer less than an hour later . NEVER again . I will use Yahoo Mail to transport my data because it can't get LOST . Buy one that is more heavy-duty , NOT THIS !
  I read a lot of good reviews for this unit and decided to get one for my self . At first , I liked it ' cause of its compact , easy to use , and good price . But after a week using it , it started locking up and freeze the screen . I could not reset or turn off the unit at all . The only way to get it reset is wait for the battery to run out . It locked up every time I used after that . I 'm returnning it now . I bought this unit from outpost . com and I don't know whether they just only sell defected units over there .
  this is great seller with good product and prompt shipping and will order from them again . headphones used for my laptop for noise blockage while listening to voices while watching video or movies . good headphones . most small headphines cannot get good connection at jack . this one works great .
  The audio technica ATH-ANC7 did not work nearly as well as passive noise reduction like I get from the Peltor H10A Earmuff . I sent them back .

  My camera went bad from a VERY COMMONLY reported manufacturing defect " camera stabilizer is not available " error message in the model I had . Since this is a common defect from the manufacture , they should have fixed my camera at their expense , but they refused to fix it without me having to pay $ 100 something for their manufacturing defect plus shipping charges ! Don't buy Casio products ! They don't stand behind the quality of their products .
  It 's nice to be able to listen to an iPod ( or any other audio source , for that matter ) in my car without having to endure breaking cassette tape converters or fuzzy FM transmitters . This connects straight to the CD changer dock in the trunk of the car ( Sable ' 98 and a few other ford models - check your compatibility ) . Because it uses red / white RCA inputs , you 'll probably have to hit Radio Shack or some other electronics store for a RCA to 3.5mm cable in order to use a MP3 player , but trust me , it 's worth the trip .
  When I purchased this product , I though that I had the right one , however , I did not . The gentleman gave me a quick rma , and refunded my purchase price . I would buy from them again .
  I got a new Imac for Christmas and a couple games . Battlefield Pacific , and X plane . After doing some research , everyone was saying how great the Logitech extreme was . And that it works on the Mac . I have to tell ya . It doesn't work on the Mac . There is no support for it , and the only good thing I can say is that tech support at Battlefield Pacific have been great . Though they haven't found a way to make this thing work . It works great on my XP though . So now I have to find a joy stick that works on my Mac .
  This adapter seemed like it was going to be a good investment . But what they do not say on the description , is that its only compatible to a computer running windows xp or lower . There is no driver for any system running anything higher than that . Anything higher than that it can not recognize . Also , it is only a USB 1.0 connection . You might as well go for the next version of this adapter , although i do not know if it would be compatible though with a usual windows 7 operating system .
  Bad product - stay away from - tape buttons don't work-put a tape in for the first time and it fast forwarded , stop button did not work and play did not work , could not get tape to stop - had to take batteries out to get my tape back . I had to send back . If I could have given this a negative star rating , it would have gotten 5 NEGATIVE stars .
  I returned this item along with the dashboard mount . I received credit for the dashboard mount but I did not receive credit for this item . Please advise . Thanks , Carl Meeks
  This is my second digital camera , the first also an Olympus . With so many features and shooting modes , I did study the manual . I first found that shooting without a flash indoors using the " auto " mode or the " P " ( program ) mode produced fuzzy images , but using the " Scene - Portrait with Available Light " function , indoor shots are clear . I love not having a removable / losable lens cap . The built in lens cover retracts as the camera turns on . The " Scene - Sports " feature produced incredibly sharp action photos at our local rodeo . The macro and super-macro feature is very good . Closeup flower images come out clear even with a little breeze blowing . I like having an optical view finder . The 5x zoom coupled with the seamless 4x digital zoom ( 20x max zoom ) produced a surprisingly sharp closeup . The one thing that isn't good - and it may be so with all digital still cameras - is the movie feature . The resolution is very low and capturing one frame for use as a photo is useless . Seems to me my older digital did a better job of using a movie to capture a child leaping from a dock so that I could select one frame from the movie to print . Perhaps I need more experience . My previous camera used AA batteries , and this one does too , so my stock of rechargeable AA batteries hasn't gone to waste . The size and weight of the camera are good . The camera comes with the Advanced Manual on CD rom , in PDF format . This is a bit of a pain if you want to have the manual with you , but at least you can print it in any size , and omit the parts ( like how to print photos ) you don't need . The manual is fairly easy to understand and navigate . The camera is easy to use ( once you know where everything is ) and I 'm very happy with it . I still have much to learn and will probably like it even more . I gave it a 4-star rating only because of the movie problem . Update : After using the camera for several months I 've noted several problems with it . It badly over-exposes when using the " scene " menu . So far , only the point-and-shoot auto settings have resulted in good photos . Doing comparison shots with my old 2.1mp Camedia 2040 , and a Nikon Coolpix , all three did a good job on automatic settings . When switching to " Scene " mode for the Sport Zoom , either in " sport " or " landscape " mode , the photos were horribly over-exposed in late afternoon lighting . Olympus has a way to fix this , I think , but when you 're in a hurry for a photo , just use the " auto " mode or buy another camera . Instead of 4 stars , I 'd give it a 2 1/2 .
  I purchased this camera after reviewing the specs and was told there was a mid-roll rewind option . After recieving the camera the manual stated the roll of film can not be reuse once you rewind it . All the cameras I purchased in the past have this feature , but to me if a camera has a mid roll rewind feature the film should be able to be used again . Also it seems that you have to tell the developer to put the date the photo was taken or they put the date it was developed on all them . But it does take nice pictures .
  I bought this because I wanted to hear stations in either Europe or the Middle East . I really can't hear any of those places . I heard Toronto , Mexico , one Asian country , and a French speaking station that wasn't come out clear enough . The AM and FM are very good , though . And it is a very small radio . But I am looking for a strong Shortwave at a bargain , and I didn't get that .
  I got this to hopefully improve my ping and FPS with WoW and Lord of the Rings Online . There was no noticeable difference vs . the integrated NIC on my motherboard ( Gigabyte Nvidia 590 series ) . I have the most recently drivers for my mobo and I feel that is about the best you can do in that regard . Don't waste your money on one of these - save it for a better graphics card or CPU .
  I bought this printer on the strength of its reviews . My goodness , Epson must have photos of the editor 's of PC magazines in compromising positions . Clogged nozzles , degrading print quality , hours debugging XP drivers . I 'm not a big review junkie , but registered with Amazon for the explicit purpose of warning you away from this printer . It 's too late for me .. but save yourselves ..
  The letters are pretty sharp on black keyboard and the rest of the squares are very clear . What else is there to say about little pieces of vinil ?
  I bought this to use with my Nikon 50mm f / 1.8 and screw on rubber lens hood . It is a perfect match there is know movement within the case . I would highly recommend this for this combination ..
  it works just fine with my i pod good sound good bass would buy again if in need of another pair
  I received the 4214 due to a 20.00 off coupon and began making coasters immediately . I never in my wildest dreams thought I could create coasters in the privacy of my home & can now die happy . To make the dream even more sweet I purchased Adaptec Easy Cd 4.1 & was making fewer coasters ( darn ) but still made some after 5 calls to Creatives answer to long distance carriers dreams ( 20 + minute hold minimum ) they agreed to replace the obviously defective unit but they insisted on sending a refurbished unit further they forced me to speak to several people in order to convince them to accept a credit card # so as to reduce my wait time ( they wanted me to return the defective unit ) wait for them to diagnose it 's malady & then after verifying that it was faulty replace it . I am convinced it is only because I have 2000.00 of their stuff that they sent me the drive without my first sending the old one back first . Now here 's the kicker the new drive they sent is a 8433E not the 8432which I had & it is not supported by the 100.00 Adaptec software I purchased due to the Nero burning rom software which came with the burner being less than good . This took numerous long distance calls to Adaptec to detirmine . so all in all I would be forced to say DO NOT BUY THIS BURNER even though now after dounloading the update for Nero to version 5.22 it does work fine . It was far too much work & when you factor the cost of the now useless Adaptec software I paid 300.00 ! DO NOT BUY THIS BURNER !
  I bought this router because of its ridiculously low price ( .. ) And I too have heard good things about the Netgear brand . The device only took 2 minutes to set up with RCN 's cable modem ( dynamic ip ) , and the web config interface is simple . But the wireless connection dies intermittently , sometimes as often as several times a day ! I have to go over to the router , unplug it , and plug it back in to reset it . Afterwards it works fine . If you 're at home , it 's a minor nuisance , but if you 're running a server or need to connect to your network when nobody 's home to reset the router , DON'T BUY THIS .
  It is manually terminated with Cat 5E Belkin cable , nothing more ! I would not recommend this purchase because of the quality and integrity of the cable . The picture of the cable is not what I got from Amazon !
  I have had to replace my iPod mini three times ? ! I have not so much as dropped it . Sometimes the battery appears to be fully charged but the iPod will cease playing in the middle of a workout . Sometimes the display light will come on by itself in the middle of the night ? ! Plugging the iPod in will sometimes rectify the problem .. sometimes not . I 've been told it is a battery issue . In addition to the iPod being possessed I 've found that I have too much music to store on this little guy . Perhaps its larger brethren are more hearty .
  This tv does in fact have high failure rate I know I purchased oneJanuary 2 2008 and the tv would turn its self off after only minuetsof watching . Little trouble shooting with Philips shows that the unit had power board failure . Also when you would turn the tv off only the screen would sometime go out the power board would remain on with led lights on the board still Glowing . you can view the green led lights on the board by looking through the vent holes from the back . When the is turned off the lights should go off PER Philips . Sometime mine would sometime they would remain on after turning the unit off . I returned the tv for replacement and the second tv did the same exact thing the TVs were MFG only one month apart . I wounder how many people have this same set that are not even aware of the power board not shouting off ? If I had two sets with same problem you know there has to be many out there with same falure . This tv looks great that is what sold me and the price and the name Philips . I got my refund and purchased a Samsung . after all this and dealing with Philips . When I see the name Philips I turn my head . Never again will I purchas a Philips brand again
  Wanted to connect a Mac Mini to a TV that had a component connection . Tried every configurations on 2 different TV 's . No dice on either . So I went with a Apple DVI-to-Composite / S-Video adapter . Now that works flawlessly !
  This was the first mp3 player I bought . I spent a good while looking around for the best deal , and the iriver seemed to be it . Besides just looking sweet , it has an FM tuner , a microphone , able to read text files and view pictures , not to mention the great amount of space on the hard drive . If this worked properly , I would have given it 5 stars . Mine however ( which i did buy online through Amazon-never buy small expensive digital things over the Internet ) froze up the first time I used it . I had the system requirements , followed the manual exactly , but the product did not work . It stayed frozen until the battery died , and once bought , you can't get a new battery . I couldn't get through to iriver at all , by phone or email . So I contacted the seller , J & R ; music , whose only option was to replace the dead thing with another product of the same price because iriver production had been discontinued . And I had to pay for the shipping and handling ! When I finally received the replacement , it had already been more than a month since the iriver had gone dead . I was ripped off . Should 've listened to a few of the other negative reviews on here . I give the iriver 2 stars only because if it actually worked it would have made a nice little investment .
  This once available product has served me well . Very dynamic , universal in use , and user friendly . What more could be asked of a simple battery backup system that doesn't cost hundreds of $ . I 'm looking for the replacement because it 's best duty is under every critical user 's computer .
  This projector worked well enough connected to a home theater system , but not good enough on it 's own . Speaker sounds awful , and the DVD player is so-so . However , after owning one for just over 2 years , I made the mistake of unplugging it to dust the table it was placed on , and when I plugged it back in , the Lamp and Temp LED 's began to flash and the unit won't power on . There were no symptoms leading up to this , we used it not 12 hours earlier with no indications of any issues . I called Optoma tech support , and they didn't even want to hear the problem , they wanted me to ship it to them for repair . I checked online sources , and the symptoms seem to indicate the Temperature Control Sensor has failed , and of course , you can't find the part anywhere to replace it yourself . Imagine that , a two-year-old electronic device that fails when you plug it back in . Absolutely disposable , I will never buy another Optoma product .
  great backpack , holds one camera with attachments well , if you need to put in a second camera it needs to have a small lens , or remove it and use a cap . would buy another if i needed it
  I bought this laptop off-the-shelf when my old laptop 's hinges broke . I 'm an IT guy - I have used lots of laptops , by lots of manufacturers , and this is hands-down the worst I 've encountered . Contrary to what some reviewers have said , Sony 's were not the most expensive laptops ; in fact , I talked myself into buying this one based largely on the price . That was a mistake , for the reasons that follow . Pros : - Was available off the shelf with reasonable specs - Uses mostly decent hardware - Integrated webcam - Quick setup out of the box - Reasonably impressive specs ( but comes with Vista , which undoes much of that value ) Cons : - Keyboard is flaky ( one of my keys died after a year , others have problems and are dying , and nearly half of them have popped off randomly at least once ) - Mouse pad is flaky ( often stops responding for a couple minutes ) - WiFi card crashes a lot ( will refuse to turn on ; will turn on but not find any networks when I am right next to a router ; will find networks with good signals and not connect ; will connect but not send anything ) - Hard drive is non-standard ( can't replace it with non-Sony drives ) - Hard drive is often very slow - Battery life is terrible ( less than 1.5 hours at full power , less than 2 on power saver mode ) - whoever said it got 4 hours was either lucky , wrong , or using an upgraded battery - CD / DVD drive is * loud * - Integrated speakers are terrible - Integrated microphone is terrible , even by laptop standards - Laptop gets * EXTREMELY * hot , even in standby . I actually worry about it starting a fire ( this does happen ; a friend 's laptop ignited her coffee table in the middle of the night ; no defects were ever identified ) . - Screen latch is badly placed and frequently flips up while I 'm using the computer - Screen hinges seem weak and flaky ; they feel weaker every day , and I fully expect one or both to break in the near future . - Screen design makes it impossible to hold the laptop in one arm when it 's closed ; no matter how you grip it or how lightly you hold it , you feel like you 're crushing or at least badly bending the screen ( because you are ) . - Screen suffers random areas of burn-out where the backlight fails or becomes permanently and abnormally bright ( this happened almost immediately when I got it , for no apparent reasons ) . - Ergonomics ? Awful . The wrist area is extremely uncomfortable . - Windows Vista is wretched . Sure , it 's pretty , but it has major speed and stability issues ; performance is often lower than XP , which is why many manufacturers are continuing to offer XP , even though Microsoft is trying to phase it out . Simple tasks like moving and copying files take forever . The hardware demands are also tremendous . - Too much pre-installed random software . Cleaning it up is a real chore . - Shortcut keys ( mute , volume up and down ) randomly start and stop working - the mute key will often light up when pressed , but fail to mute the speakers , for example . Sometimes , they reverse their functions , and do the opposite of what they 're supposed to do . - Screen brightness is too narrow a range . I often can't get it bright enough in certain settings , but can't turn it down enough when working in dim light . Given the chance to do it over again , I would happily pay a few hundred dollars more for a different manufacturer , even if it meant giving up a little on the specs . This laptop is simply not worth the money , and after only 13 months of ownership I 'm already contemplating replacing it in the near future .
  I recently bought this camera and was very excited about the hype . This camera looks great , very " quality " feeling , I also find it has the ability to take great pictures , you just have to experiment with the settings . My only gripe about the camera is that the sound quality is SO bad . My 4 year old camera sounds clearer ! If you don't care about the sound quality then I would recommend this camera for you . Overall , it 's good enough .
  After first conection device was working good , after 4 - th conections was dead ! I plugged into system , the device just keeps clicking clicking clicking amounting to nothing , wont mount to system . eThese things are cheap , sleek and cute looking but I would not trust them with any important data . I lost all my data ! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT ! SAVE YOUR MONEY and don't give it to companies such as this . Outside looking good inside big piece of junk !
  It works well for me . Before I bought it , I saw someone said something negative about this router . But the truth is it is compatiable with the windows vista . Easy install , stable signal . If the price can be lower a little bit , that would be best .
  It 's speaker wire , what more could you expect ? 1 ) It 's white so it blends with white walls , and 2 ) it 's color coated . My only complaint is that the color is more of an off-white / cream , not a big deal though . Does the job .
  I received this item . I must have misunderstood the terms , because I thought I was buying " new " unit . Unfortunately , I have experienced difficulties with the unit pretty much from the time I received it . It is now not functioning ( device is not recognized by my USB port ) . Seller has not been very communicative , and to date has not responded to my request for repair or replacement . I recommned that you source your ipods elsewhere .
  I thought I 'd be smart and buy less expensive cartridges for my HP Color LaserJet . I thought that rather than buy a no-name , off-brand I 'd go with Xerox thinking I could trust the quality . I was wrong on all counts . I bought the magenta and the yellow cartridges . The yellow cartridge I purchased is defective , but because I don't use the printer often ( though when I do it 's for very important , big jobs ) I didn't realize the cartridge was not working properly until well after the return window had closed . Without proper yellow saturation , all of my documents , including those that are supposed to be plain black text are purple . Legal contracts in purple . Cute . Almost $ 90 for a defective cartridge . Not cute . PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful . So , please vote ( the " Was this review helpful to you : Yes or No " buttons ) and leave a comment if you 'd like , even if it 's just to say , " Hi ! " I respond to all comments so feel free to ask a question about the product . Also , when you leave a comment , I will go to your reviews and pay you the same courtesy .
  I bought this router , ran it for a couple of days to make sure it worked okay , the reloaded it with the ( Linux based ) software from [ .. ] I now have more functionality and can adjust parameters such as the power level ( I increased the 28mw setting to 70mw ) .
  I received my 955 3 days ahead of the estimated delivery date .. way to go Amazon ! Some people say the unit is heavy .. I prefer to call it " solid . " It 's bigger and heavier than my 6-yr old unit , but hey , not all electronics are miniturized and this unit has a lot of features . No problem mounting to windshield or with the unit not sitting snug .. no unwanted vibration or noise . I know the unit works .. it picks up traffic speed signs more than a mile away , and I dodged one speed trap already . I especially like the feature where the unit " announces " the type of radar so I don't have to take my eyes off the road . Brightness settings are good and sound volume is okay out of the box ( adjustable ) if you are not listening to the radio / CD at 105 decibles . So far , it 's been a great unit .
  Don't worry about the lack of a picture - this is the battery you need to replace your Uniden BT-446 . It is an exact size replacement with the proper connector . It comes in retail ( card / blister ) packaging .
  This remote works perfectly out of the box and is very easy to program for the TV set . I replaced a worn out remote , so it is great to have every option work on the first push now .
  This company offers overpriced screens and is unresponsive and unfriendly to customers who have a problem . If you want a less expensive screen protector of simiilar quality , try Clarivue .
  Do yourself a favor and skip this product for following reasons :* Wireless implementation is a joke and not working if you want to add security to your network ( only works when removing encryption which you really do not want to do on your WiFi network ) . I am a network engineer with 10 + years of experience and this frame is the crapiest WiFi implementation I 've ever seen . * Interface is real clunky . * The frame can not auto start and display pictures out of your kodak gallery without the need to go play around with the remote . * Technical support is a frustrating experience : Long wait and they do not know a whole lot either . * A very frustrating experience really .. Too bad I can not give 0 stars on this one .
  I got a couple of these L2410NM monitors , and have been very pleased with them . To make it clear , there IS an HDMI input . There is NOT a DVI . There is also a VGA input , component / progressive scan input , standard RCA input and S-Video input . I 've used all the input connections , and only the HDMI input will continue to give you a blue screen if the PC is put to sleep ( which is a shame ) . I mostly use the monitor for doing large network Visio drawings and graphics work , and recently I dedicated one to become a media station connected to a spare PC running Windows Media Center . It works great for this purpose , but I had to fall back on the VGA input because it was too annoying to put the PC to sleep and still have the monitor turned on . I really couldn't tell the difference anyway in quality since I have the resolution turned down to 1280 x 768 in order to make web surfing visible from across the room . The menus are classic Westinghouse with buttons you have to " feel for " along the right hand side . I really wish they would replace the buttons and make them easy to find and easily labelled . The menu system really isn't bad .. it 's having to work the menus by " feel " that sucks . I 've used it a lot for video games , TV , DVD 's , and graphics work on the PC and I 'm really pleased with what I got for the price . The only actual " bug " is the blue screen when you use the HDMI signal when the PC is turned off . Tom
  I bought this on sale at Staples for $ 99 . It was a disaster . I have always bought HP printers because they have been so reliable and well designed . This unit seems to be the exception . It smears ink all over the page on printouts , even after multiple cleanings . Sometimes a 20 page print job takes 20 minutes , someimtes five minutes . I don't know if I just got a lemon or if HP tried to pack too much into a small unit and all the units are prone to defective output . On the plus side , I bought it for the scanner and the scanner semmed to work really well .
  Trying to move some old files from my old G4 to my new MacBook , I was hoping an external zip drive would do the trick . Macs are supposed to have built in drivers for this unit , and it 's advertised to be compatible , but it didn't work and the seller - no surprise - wasn't willing to refund me . If you are a Mac user , I strongly suggest you investigate other options for transferring files .
  What 's in this , about 1 oz of ink ? You go through these like bottled water . I guess its obvious why Epson doesn't have clear ink containers like the knock offs - you'ld see it was almost empty when you bought it .
  There is no driver support for modern PC 's - DO NOT BUY . As a PC enthusiast I 've been using 64 bit operating systems for 6 yrs as they support more than 3gb of ram .. I was appalled to see this product not support that .
  I am bitterly disappointed with the Philips DVDR-3400 recorder , and suppose that all of its line has the same problems . I did not find out until I had burned 300 + DVDs that the disk directory structure created by these Phillips machines is defective . The main title on the disk you make will appear to " play " on your home DVD player .. but ALL of the post-recording edits made ( cutting out parts you didn't want etc . ) are LOST . AND most PC-based DVD players and other software won't handle the disk , so if you wrote your home movies to disk for long-term archiving , you 're out of luck . I don't know how a company the size of Phillips can release such a piece of crap . They HAD to know of these problems . I am sick to think of the time I have lost . All I have is junk to show for it . And yes , I did everything right ( finalizing the disks etc ) . Add to this the terrible remote control with rubbery , no-feedback keys that often don't work ; little provision for using the deck for playback , etc . etc . ( read other 's complaints ) and you have a real loser here . I bought my first Phillips tape recorder in 1968 . I will never buy another Phillips product .
  From the reviews provided by GPSer , C320 looks like a perfect machine with reasonable price , but now the price got up more than $ 150 now at Amazon . com . Personally , I think it is not a good time to buy this unit now , maybe after the new type of the Garmin unit comes out with reasonable prices . I will wait .
  As the other reviewers have said , they do sound great , but they allow too much sound to escape . I planned to use them at work , but I can't because of that . Get the ear canal types , or the headphones with an enclosure around the entire ear .
  It astonishes me that Microsoft has become such a huge conglomerate that they can not even support their OWN PRODUCTS . If you read through the many reviews of this product on Amazon , it comes to light that this product is supported on Vista , but not on 64bit Vista . GO FIGURE . My question , then , is this : Why make a second version of an operating system , if almost NOTHING works with it ? Why offer it to consumers , knowing damn well that what you 're selling them won't work with the OTHER things youre selling them ? WHY ? ! ? ! ? To make more money from us middle-class idiots , that 's why . I didn't buy this item from Amazon , but another large retailer , and now I have to return it , because I spent 2 hours trying to track down a way to make this work on my new HP laptop with Vista 64bit . Needless to say , it doesn't work . I guess I could blame myself for buying a computer with 64bit , but still . I shouldn't have to . This product would be amazing if it actually worked . But , unfortunately for myself , and many others like me , it doesn't , and Microsoft obviously doesn't care one way or the other . Because , after all , they got my money for Vista being on this laptop I 'm using right now , and they got my money for a Fingerprint Reader that is made by Microsoft , but not supported by Microsoft . Thanks a lot , Bill Gates and company , you made even more money than you already need .
  What a great camera in such a small package . I do recommend to use with 400 film , I just have not felt comfortable using 800 film on it .
  All those people saying this is not a plextor 16x , why don't you open your eyes wider and look at the pictures of the Iomega on this site . It clearly shows that it has the fan and the exact same front and back faceplates . Compare it to the pictures of the Plextor unit . I own the unit so I know . If you don't own the unit , then don't disparage it !
  I could not agree more on the issue brought up here . As if there were not already enough memory formats , yet another one . It seems to be about either desperate , or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever . Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory ? This is as bad as it would be to have 5 + formats of CD-RoM drives . And SONY is even more guilty than fuji / olympus . Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba / Fuji / Olympus , and now Fuji / Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba / Panasonic for the sD card . Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices . We need to standardize the market . We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device . If you buy Fuji / 0lympus , I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD . Together the people can control the market for our own good ..
  I bought an air card fro this seller , and it was broken . I wasn't able to use it , and the person who sold it to me never responded . Very pissed I was . With electronics , you have better chances spending a little more at FRY 's electonics or the like , than on Amazon . Too much hassel that what it 's worth .
  I bought this item and simply plugged it into the parallel printer port on my printer and then into a USB port on my Dell Studio XPS 9000 running Windows 7 . Windows recognized the printer immediately and automatically installed the printer driver , without my having to do anything else . When I went to Devises and Printers on the Control Panel , my LaserJet 4 Plus showed up as a functional printer ( after a 30-second delay ) . I was then able to print a sample document . No fuss , no problems . After it was all installed , I noticed that it came with an instruction booklet and a little CD . I didn't need to use either .
  For someone who wants to start taking great pictures , this turned out to be great camera ! I like how Canon has divided the dial into pre-set and creative zones so you can select to take a quick picture or use the easy programming feature to capture the scene the way you want . For example , you can select the shutter speed and it will select the correct aperture automatically . That makes it a lot easier for people who are not professional photographers . The best part is that by turning the dial to the green box I can use it as a point and click for those run-of-mill quick pictures . Its a regular Jekyll and Hyde , this one ! On the downside , a beginner like me had real trouble figuring out how to take great pictures using the manual that came with the camera . I found that the $ .. for the CANON EOS Rebel 2000 book by Heiner Henninges and Bob Shell was well worth it . If you are not quite conversant with Canon SLRs spent the extra few bucks and you will really enjoy using the great features of this camera .
  I purchased this item through Amazon and received it from an Amazon vendor the next day . That is the only thing I can say positive about the product . I am not sure if it is old and has been laying around for years or not , but since I have an older model laser printer HP 5P , these cartridges are not easily found at good prices anywhere . My old cartridge was running out of toner ink and my copies were getting lighter . This new cartridge is great for dark black tones , but there are 4 stripes that run across the page . I tried cleaning the cartridge and cleaning my printer , but to no avail . Since I use this all the time for my work , I am very unhappy with this product . I think that Amazon should make sure that their vendors are not selling old and / or defective products . When I print an envelope , there are 4 black stripes across the front and it looks terrible . Since I threw out the box and the purchase details , I did not know where to send it for replacement ! I hope other people do not have this same problem .
  I bought this for the extension cable less than 6 months ago , and it 's already deteriorating . Specifically , I need to make sure the cable is in exactly the right position for the audio to go through . The fact that this happened so quickly screams low quality manufacturing to me . I 'm looking elsewhere in the future .
  I went to replace this battery in my CoolPix P5100 and could not get the battery out of the camera normally . I finally had to force the battery out . It was just in time also , because the battery had swollen in the middle on front and back . It is a genuine Nikon EN-EL5 battery and the camera has never been in extreme heat . This is to warn people to check this battery more often than you would another battery . I am trying to find the Warranty Period if anyone knows .
  Got it this morning .. little tight on the fit with my 190CXPRO3 and a 484RC2 Mini Ball Head with RC2 Rapid Connect Plate attached . Quality is good .. price is a bit high . Funny story though .. this little flat package arrived via Prime .. UPS in a huge box nearly 4 foot tall and about 12x12 and stuffed with about a dump truck load of brown wrapping paper . Geesh ..
  It worked once when first connected and then it self destructed . I get nothing but static . Static on every station option . Static on every IPOD setting . This FM Transmitter is a big , big disappointment .
  I would 've given no stars but apparently that isn't an option . I bought this amp a few months ago , and it performed adequate , so I figured I would keep it instead of pony up more dough to get another one . And then randomly it stopped working . After two months of usage I could no longer turn my stereo on loud enough to hear it . It would continually shut off . So I asked to return it , and they complied , and now that I have shipped it back to them , I am only getting a partial refund . This is a joke . I would never buy any electrical equipment from this seller ever !
  Before ordering , I read other reviews of this product which stated that the switching was occasionally sensitive to seizure if components being switched were powered on . I have not experienced this issue . During setup , I did experience slight connectivity issue with unit recognizing connected inputs , but not since . This unit works great for me and has solved my component switching problems . Note : the light emitted from this unit is very bright and might not work well in bedrooms where light can affect environment . Overall I recommend .
  After using her old Presto for 25 + years , part of the pressure release mechanism broke . Thanks God ! She had found a couple of Prestos on line , and asked me to order one for her . I asked if she had checked Amazon and she admitted that she hadn't . I told her to wait a minute and let me do a little checking . At Amazon I found the same pressure cooker for about $ 10 less , and it included Free Shipping . I ordered it on a Sunday and it was delivere by Wednesday . She really liked the looks of it , and when she tried it for the first time , she found out that she didn't need to cook things as long as with her " antique " Presto . She showed it to her mother and five minutes later I was ordering another one for her . It 's a pleasure to have TWO happy females around , especially when I get the credit ! Thanks Amazon for keeping your prices competitive , and that Free Shipping is GREAT ! - Ken Fisher
  A must have product for every individual that is connected to Computers in the daily life . Carry huge data files in your pocket without feeling an ounce of load on you . Great for sharing picures , videos , and Books with your friends and co-workers ! Great Price too !
  They must b / c I don't know how they 're all so happy with it . I 'm not going to write a long diatribe here , but I want to caution potential buyers of the e270 . For starters , it 's NOT compatible with Napster To Go nor Y ! Music Unlimited To Go subscription-based services . It is compatible with Rhapsody , but set up is difficult and you MUST HAVE USB 2.0 on your computer . The MTC protocol ( see , I told you it is difficult . . . and I 'm not that technologically savvy ) only works with USB 2.0 , not 1.1 , which I have . Also , it scratches way easily . If you do purchase this product then get a cover for it . The controls are sluggish in terms of moving from one song to the next , but the scroll wheel is pretty cool . I also wish the sound output and the bass response were better . The bass is a little flat for my taste and when you 're in the gym or on a plane , you can hear all sorts of backround noise b / c it isn't loud enough . ( And yes , I went ahead and purchased the Shure earphones for $ 150 and I 'm still not pleased with the sound performance ) . I can't totally trash the player , although I 'm super dissapointed with it . . . especially in light of how much money I spent on it . Customer Support has been great . Quick and responsive . The player design is cool . It 's small , but not to tiny so that the controls are difficult to operate . The scroll wheel is cool and the graphic display is bright and cool looking . Overall , if you 're looking for a player that 's compatible with all of the music to go , subscription-based services , look further than the e270 . If you are cool with paying per song , go with the Nano and itunes . Oh , and who cares about the expansion slot . 6GBs are enough .
  Excellent product ! Since buying this one for myself , I 've helped a couple of other friends purchase and then setup their own wireless networks at home and business . WOW ! In every case , it took less than 5 minutes from the point of picking up the package , through unpacking it , positioning it , booting the computer and getting online ! ( This IS based on having read the instructions first , but they weren't needed really . Just plug it in and reboot ! ) Setting up the shared drives and printers , if so desired , was also easy enough for anyone that can read and follow the instructions provided . The one recommendation I 'd like to offer for Linksys would be a power swith of some sorts to easily disable the wireless component . My main desktop is wired via ethernet cable while I have others setup wirelessly . I 'd like to be able to simply push a button to turn off the wireless component when I know I or noboby else will be using it . I have WEP enabled , but I 'd just rather not broadcast the signal when I 'm not using it . Call me paranoid perhaps , but it 'd be a small concession that I 'd gladly pay the extra buck it 'd cost Linksys . Regardless , it 's still and excellent product !
  Mine stopped working about 2 months after the warranty ran out . A waste of my hard earned cash . Replaced it with a Samsung V3650 . Works flawlessly . Did i mention the toshiba was junk ?
  Had this awitch for about two weeks .. Beats the heack out of my pld LinkSys . Have 2- NAS 's Two HDMI Micro Computers on HDTV 's two printers a Lap Top and two Wireless Access Points . All work great together . By the time I wrote this I subsiquently purchased a D-Link 24 port Rack Mountable Switch to replace / add to this one .
  The sound is good while they last , but the build quality of these is NOT good . Neither is the customer service . 1st Pair : A couple of months after buying these , part of the earphone came out along with the cord when I unplugged the cord . I sent the earphones to ultimate ears to get fixed . 2 months later I had not received a replacement pair . They lost the pair I sent in . I kept calling - the ultimate ears rep kept telling me they needed my receipt , which I had sent to them previously . Then the rep said he had to talk to a supervisor and would get back to me . He never did . Finally I called and frankly threw a fit until they got a supervisor on the phone then and there . 2nd Pair : 2 months later I got a replacement - but last week , part of the plastic near where the cord plugs in broke off and now they are unusable again . Rather than go through their customer service again , I am buying some Shures . 3rd Pair : My third pair was a pair of EBs . They broke the first time I wore them . You might think that I mistreated these , having gone through 3 pairs . But honestly , I don't throw these around or pull on the cords or anything like that . Shoddy ! Paul
  With only a few caveats , I like these earphones very much . I listen mostly to classical music , and it sounds more clear and natural with these earphones than with any others I own ( Sony and Sennheiser ) . I tried my sister-in-law 's Bose noise cancelling headphones and liked them , but I think I like these much more . They block out sound better than the Bose headphones did , and the bass is more natural . I like that these are smaller - they 're much more portable . These earphones are ideal for orchestral and vocal music . I hear every instrument , every note . I also hear every defect in my source material and am now in the process of re-recording music to my iPod with less compression . I don't like them quite as much for organ music . The bass is beautiful , but it lacks the visceral element of the bass produced by my regular sound system . I studied organ at UT on a large pipe organ , and I liked the way deep bass passages made my rib cage resonate . No headphones can reproduce that effect . There are a few things I don't like about these earphones . I 'm getting used to having them in my ear canals , but I still find the sensation a little unpleasant . I have to make chewing and yawning motions when I insert them to get my ear canals lined up properly to accept them . But this is getting better , and I think that it will soon cease to be an issue . I agree with reviewers who can't easily tell which phone is left and which is right , but as it happens , I don't really mind switching left and right . If I did , I 'd probably mark one phone with a dot of nail polish . I think the list price is excessive , but the Amazon price was quite reasonable for the product . I don't understand the reviewer who said that the Etymotic earphones stick out of his ears - mine are much less noticeable than the earbuds that came with my iPod and they rest pretty flat against my ear . My overall experience with these is quite positive . I 'm liking them more every day . They really do block out sound , so not only should you not wear them when driving or biking or running , you also shouldn't wear them when your spouse is around . I caught mine looking at me rather crossly the first night I got them ( they very nicely blocked out the sound of misbehaving children and my wife 's attempts to make them settle down ) , and I resolved not to use them at home unless everyone else is in bed .
  I was looking for a quiet keyboard that wouldn't wake up my toddler like my stock Dell keyboard did , and one that lit up so I could type in the dark . This one fit the bill perfectly . I 've had it for 2 months and no problems . It 's already put up with some abuse from my toddler without a scratch . The keys aren't as quiet as I had hoped , but I don't really see how they could get any quieter unless you made them out of a softer material . Others complained about having to change the light color after restart , but it 's so easy to do by pushing one button it 's not worth mentioning in my opinion . I love and recommend this keyboard !
  It 's thin and sturdy , but the lens-facing threads are not perfectly round . It takes some care to thread onto ( or off of ) the lens . Nevertheless , it 's quite a bit easier than attaching / detaching a filter directly to the lens .
  I always loved Sony TV until I have this one . It 's a big disappointment . At first the TV was working just fine , then it start to turn off by itseft . Sometimes , it turn off itself right after I just turn on . Then one day it just won't turn on at all . I thought the lamp was bad , so I replace the lamp but that didn't fix the problems . Called Sony and was told this is out of warranty because I have the TV a little bit over 2 years . They gave me a couple numbers to call for repair . They found out the circuit board of the TV is bad and the total call to fix this TV is $ 730 . Plus they also told me the light engine will be next to be broken too . SONY TV SUCKS ! I 'll never buy SONY TV again !
  Media code is MCC 01RG20 , which is Mitsubish Chemicals Corporation . They have an excellent reputation , which is why I was so surprised that this media is as bad as it is . I 'm using a Plextor PX-708A with the 1.08 firmware revision . The first 4X burn produced a coaster with tons of bad sectors , and visible dye damage . The second at 4X also had visible dye damage , but my recorder was able to read each sector . My Sony DVD player ( older and picky ) couldn't read it . A 2X burn produced something my DVD player could handle ( at least the title screen comes up , and the titles start playing - haven't checked playability across the entire disc ) . There 's still visible dye damage , so I 'm skeptical . Having bought this media so I could burn at 4X to produce something my DVD player will like ( have to burn at 2.4X with my + R media to achieve that ) , I 'm quite disappointed with the results .
  It is what it is .. perfection ! Its Domke i.e. high and reputable quality . It allows for a lot of storage of gear , junk , throwing stars and anything else you would want to put in a utility belt pouch . I have my belt modeled after Batman 's belt , except I carry back-up batteries , CF cards , a Quantum battery pack and the required cables for of camera flash shooting . So , its big enough for the reasonable user . Buy it . Buy it now . You will not regret it .
  I purchased the MN-500 Wireless Base Station last May and it worked great all summer . In fact , it is the simplest router I have ever used . Setup was simple , quick , and it enabled all the security features automatically , as opposed to using default settings that are easily compromised . However , after three months of using this device , it simply stopped working . The lights did not blink ; they all just stayed lit . Technical support was very helpful and sent me a replacement promptly and I was just as pleased with the new unit . Suspiciously enough , this same problem occurred a mere three months later . I will not comment on the technical support the second time around , but they sent me a new router , anyway . The third MN-500 I received was the new and improved version of the product , released with the same features as the MN-700 Wireless Base Station sans wireless-G capabilities . In other words , it was now using a " Commercial-Grade SPI Firewall . " To say the least , the new MN-500 not only had the same capabilities as all the other MN-500 Wireless Base Stations I had received , but it was in fact , the SAME router . It did not have any of the additional enhancements that were listed on the box and it used the same firmware version as the previous models . I saw nothing in the router configuration concerning control of the firewall by any means different than was previously available . My understanding ( in dealing with LINKSYS products ) is that a Stateful Packet Inspection ( SPI ) Firewall gives you more control over incoming packets than the choice to simply enable or disable the firewall , which is the only choice given for the MN-500 . Even when I updated the firmware , I still saw no change to this feature and was very disappointed that it did not give me more advanced controls over my Internet connection . On the bright side , the base station has given me strong wireless connections and I have never received a drop-off in communication between any wired or wireless device with this product . Nevertheless , this product needed to be replaced twice and does not have any of the features a computer user might want . I turned to the WRV-54G Wireless VPN Broadband Router from LINKSYS , and despite its poor remarks here at Amazon . com , I have never had a single problem . ( Please note that I update all my firmware promptly upon each release . )
  I was putting this together when the antenna just broke off . They have the antennas swivel heads on so tight that they easily just snap off . This also has a huge clumsy AC plug which is unnecessary and a waste of precious plug space . When I returned this to the store , I saw another person retuning this exact same model also . GE has a much better model that I bought instead that doesn't break and doesn't have any AC plug which works wonderfully . Don't waste your money on this RCA antenna . I give it ZERO stars .
  This flashlight is small and light to carry and give a strong light for inside , I use it for outside to check out my ranch at night it works great for its size , I can see at 50 meter , 100 would be better for me but I just walk a little more and it does it . I used it 2 weeks already 15 min . every day without charging and it is still good .
  Watch out if you buy the mouse 6000 . The wheel on my mouse has gotten progressively harder to turn over the year I have been using it . I finally tried cleaning / lubricating the wheel with eyeglass cleaner and BreakFree CLP . It helps for a minute , then it is back to dragging . I believe the wheel is rubbing on something in the housing . The wheel tries to do too much : tilts to side and depresses for clicks . I have two cheeper models which are a pleasure to use compared to this one . For $ 70.00 bucks I should not be looking to replace it . Ken
  I almost went with the competing ' iKlear ' product but after reading reviews here , I decided on this product and I have not been disappointed . Works well on my MBP screen and cheaper IBM work laptop . Great value getting two bottles of this for the price .
  I bought many sets for my speelites and noticed they didnt hold a charge very long . I bought the la crosse charger which test batteries and they tested between 60 and 1500 mah and they claim to be 2700 . these batteries should be taken off the market ! the only cool thing about the company was that they refunded me my money .
  I got this camera from my uncle like 3 years ago . I was so excited when I got it but it doesn't really work . The batteries run out really quick and it 's really hard to put them on to the computer . There 's no flash so I couldn't take nighttime pictures . The pictures come out blurry and overall it 's worth the price because it barely functions .. I wouldn't buy it !
  very cheap construction , doesn't hold camera unless you screw it in really tightly , which causes the tripod to fall apart . If that 's fine with you , then this tripod is great !
  Firstly , You have to apply A LOT of pressure to the 2.5 plug into the usb dongle in order for it to completely be plugged in , I was a little afraid that I was going to break it during this process because the construction seems pretty cheap . The product I recieved has a 3 inch usb dongle and a headset with a cable that is approximately 4 to 4.5 feet in length , which contradicts some of the reviews for this product as well as the pictures that are shown for this product . The review that I read stated that there were two parts to the cable , the 1st being about 4 feet long plugs into the 2nd part that is about 5 feet long bringing the total cable length to about 9 feet long . That is what I expected to recieve , but somehow I didn't . I spoke with a plantronics customer service rep and he claimed that he had the exact same product ( mx500i ) in front of him and that the cable was as long as his desk , which he said was about 12 feet long . He said that amazon . com was giving misinformation about the product and / or selling a different product than the mx500i . I asked him if the product specifications had changed for this model and he denied that the product specs have ever changed . The model number on the box of the product I recieved says mx500i . The product documentation from plantronics website along with the packaged documentation that I recieved with this product is EXTREMELY vague to say the least . DO NOT expect to recieve what you see in the photos for this product , nor what many of the reviews state about this product . I 'm not sure where to put the fault of this but never-the-less I 'm disappointed because I didn't recieve what I was expecting to , thus the bad review . Other than that the product seems to work alright , but its a little rediculous because I cannot sit more than 3 feet from my 24 inch lcd , which gets a little hard on the eyes . The plantronics representative also strongly suggested that I do not try to add a 2.5 audio cable as an extension because it would most likely yeild detrimental results . I 'm going to take a chance and order a 2.5 extension anyways . My suggestion to amazon . com and / or plantronics , get your stuff straight and inform your customers about what they are going to recieve correctly .
  This card is the most inexpensive one I could find and it does the job it is supposed to do . I think it is a tad slower ( just my rough observation without any measuring instrument ) but not as much that I would hate this card . Works well , price is right .
  I have been using Verbatim Lightscribe disk for about a year with no problems at all . Unfortunatly that is not the case with this batch . Every disk fails when burning to them unless I burn at 4X speed or slower . When at 4X I only had about a 50 % fail rate . I had purchased a total of 60 disk and had over 40 fail .
  I bought this to take to Las Vegas , as most of the hotels there don't have coffee pots in the room . It was slightly heavier than I thought it would be , but it traveled very well . It is actually smaller than the 4 cup drip coffee pots . I just wrapped it in some bubble wrap , and put it in the bottom section of my travel tote . It made good coffee , and very hot . Do be prepared to have it throw off airport security . My tote was searched at both airports . I would recommend purchasing the " recommended " filters which do a good job of making sure there are no grounds in your coffee .
  I was drawn to the sleek design and thought the price wasn't bad either . I bought it for my office where it doesn't get much use ( until after business hours ) . I am constantly fighting with static and station reception and have had to hang the antenna wires all over everything for a clear signal . Now , at about 8 months , the CD player has completely stopped working . This unit no longer reads , recognizes or plays any CD 's not matter what I do . So , now I own a nice looking , static playing radio that if you 're not careful will trip you up in it 's antenna wires .
  Great quality cord . Thick coating to make it last through the years , good solid heads , all the pins are strait , and the signal is good too . Great purchase
  Top quality , really big . I can fit my Nikon D50 , 70-300mm lense , 28-70mm lense , Samsung DC164 camcorder , tapes , all the chargers , all the cables , all the manuals , and still have room for a little more . I bought this to travel to Europe . I 'm really excited ! I love this bag . The only negative thing is I hate having to unclip those two side clips ..
  I really wanted to like this mp3 player . I was trying to replace my 1G Shuffle , which has been kind physically contorted with superglue since the cheap Apple armband snapped off the USB connector . My main purpose : to use it at the gym and to be able to listen to some podcasts when I 'm walking around Downtown ( I was in Seattle at the time ) . I kept trying to defend its problems , but the last straw was when it broke in under 6 months . The right channel of sound just stopped working altogether . If I was an electrical engineer I might take it apart and try tightening whatever was loose to cause this problem , but I honestly didn't even feel that it was worth doing that . Let me list all the things I hated about it : -I 'll start with the issue of crashing . It crashed a few times a week . It would just be playing a song , and then it would freeze . Or it would be choppy in playing a track . That was especially irritating . - The navigation was completely unintuitive on it . It was not easy or enjoyable to move around in it or select tracks . - No one mentions this , but it 's a huge problem : you CANNOT make playlists on the computer ! I tried all sorts of things to try to make one and put it on there , but none of my attempts worked , and the manual only explains making playlists on the device . You have no idea how frustrating it is to have to make playlists for the gym on the device , which would take me at least 5-10 minutes for a 5 or 6 hour playlist . I much preferred using iTunes . - The radio receiver was really bad . I 'd have to be in the right place at the right time to get clear reception of anything . - The screen quality so not as good as it may appear in the pictures . Looking at photos on this thing is not worth trying . - If you stop listening to your playlist to just play normal music , it doesn't remember where you 're at . - It 's a little bigger than it looks , especially in a neoprene case for working out . - It didn't come with any special software , you just use Windows Media Player . - The battery life was not that great . It may have lasted 7-10 hours . My 1G Shuffle was a lot better than that . I really can't think of any reasons to get this device . The armband I bought from DLO for it worked a lot better than the Apple armband for my shuffle , but that 's about it . Even for just working out , this device isn't worth it . You could pay a few more bucks and get a 2G Shuffle if you 're looking for a low-end device ; the new one is actually easier for workouts .
  The extended handle of my " Targus OCN700 15 Side Access Notebook Roller " was broken in my first trip . The handle bars were stuck inside the bag and now could be extended only by 2/3 of its full length . Once it was stuck inside , it was impossible to fix or even just check out . I got really disappointed and want to warn anybody considering to buy it .
  I bought this about a year ago and it worked well until my apartment building had an actual power surge-then , not so well . In my apartment , ever electric item that was plugged in and NOT on a powersurge protector was completely fried . My computer equipment , which was on a regular $ 8 surge protector was fine ( although the surge protector was destroyed ) . Now , my TV equipment ( Wii , stereo , playstation , etc ) was not as good and this was on the Smart Strip . Although all appliances were off at the time of the surge , but television still made a popping sound and started to smoke . It is burned out . Most of the other appliances seem okay , but it is hard to check them when your apartment is being rewired and I don't have a TV to check it all . They all turn on , but the DVD player seems to overheat quickly . If you want to be eco-friendly and save energy , buy a regular powerstrip and just turn it off when you aren't using it . At least you won't have to put all your equipment in a landfill when your electricity has a freak problem !
  Product worked great for 1 year and inexplicably the HD failed and no longer works . As an IT person , I 've tried everything ( swapping out cables , power and even tried connecting the device to my laptop and backup PC ) . It was good while it lasted . Now I 've lost 100GB of data . If you plan on buying , please remember to backup your LaCie HD .
  Works great , no problems at all . Also looks and feels like a quality product . Wish I bought two !
  I am very particular about my music quality and I thought that buying thes sony headphones might be ok and possibly the only ones that stay in my ears . How wrong I was . They are uncomfortable and the quality of sound is apalling . Don't buy them .
  I really like this product because I raise dogs and I can put each dog on with different colored disks and just look for the color and its easier to find instead of looking and looking through all my black floppies to find the right one . Thanks again , Karon
  Shredded paper goes in your recycle bin ; plastic bags do not . I had not thought of using a bag , but there are biodegradeable tall kitchen bags and smaller food waste bags that I guess could be used .
  I was looking for a cheap yet good quality FireWire card for a work PC , since I work with video , I needed a card that could download DV footage to the PC . This fit the bill perfectly . I was worried at getting a cheap one since it could potentially cause system instability ( anything you add to a PC can ) , but this one had plenty of positive reviews , so I figured I 'd take the plunge . I popped it into a free PCI port , started up Windows 7 , and it was instantly recognized as a 1394 compliant device , drivers installed right away , and that was it . No need for a disk , just plug and play . The device functions as it should , have had it for a couple months now , and no issues whatsoever . In case you 're unfamiliar , the instructions are included and actually pretty decently written , although it is a pretty quick procedure . Windows XP and up should automatically recognize and install drivers for it , so you shouldn't need a disk , just plug-n-play .
  Nowhere on the item description does it say this product come 's with a foreign power transformer . There is no way to plug this adapter into a United States Spec Plug . False advertising , product does not work and was not sold as described . Went to store to purchase a universal adapter . When plugged in , this also did not work , meaning unit was dead and defective . Complete waste of time and money . Do yourself a favor and buy something else . Will be returning for refund .
  I agree with all of the previous reviewers . One of my niggles is that it only comes with a single HDMI input . The remote is pretty much destined for the pile of other unused remotes . I hate that the volume control meter doesn't show when you adjust the volume by default . To enable this means that you also have to see for like 5 minutes the video input ( TV , HDMI , VIDEO1 , VIDEO2 , .. ) selection in the upper right hand corner . Very small issues really . The big thing is this - both Target and Sears have this TV available for as low as $ 800 . Makes me wonder if there is something wrong with this TV . But I 've had it for almost a month now with no regrets . An Update , 8 Months Later = Still works great , no issues with this tv at all . I agree that the tv response speed when using the remote could be better , but I 'm trying REALLY hard to think of something negative about this TV . TBSHD was just added in our area and the MLB Playoff coverage looks fantastic on this TV .
  Ditto stevec50 's comments . As an engineer , I couldn't get the device to work , either . To make matters worse , if you have your bidirectional printer switched " on " when you restart your machine , you get a Blue Screen . Belkin 's latest driver upgrade ( October 1999 ) does not resolve any problems ( even though the Readme text says it does ) , and their technical support is clueless . My recommendation is to find another route for your parallel devices , such as an A-B switch , an autoswitch , or by adding another ISA parallel port card . Beware of the latter , though . My new Micron Millennia Max 733 has no ISA slot ! ( I was told that is the way of the future - no ISA . )
  These headphones sound great , but after less than nine months of use , the cheap plastic headband is cracking apart , and I 'd give them another week before it breaks down completely . Sennheiser put some great drivers into some comfortable headphones here , but if they have a terrible quality headband , what 's the point ? Given the knowledge that these would utterly wear out so quickly , I would not have bought them .
  It 's true ! Works out of the box for Ubuntu .. and Windows XP . After spending waay too much time trying to make a couple of old webcams work on Ubuntu , I decided that it was time to move on . I picked up this webcam , and as the box advertises , it works straight out of the box on Linux . No hassles , no tears , no frustration . It just worked perfectly and made a perfect addition to Skype ! I just wish it had a microphone !
  I got it for my son 's birthday he absolutely loves them . The price was just right and the quality top notch . I have own apair top-end head phones with noise cancellation and for the price it was perfect .
  I wanted something that charges the iPod and plays it through the stereo speakers and the iTrip auto was the simplest product to do exactly that . I haven't had any problems with this except for when I 'm in between bigger cities where the radio stations are mixed I have to find a new frequency to transfer on . I would prefer that the FM transmitter be a little more powerful but all in all this does what I need it to do .
  This works fine with my MAC Mini and the X10 radio remote antenna .
  I love the feel and ease of the keys . It 's like typing on air . I really believe my speed and dexterity has improved . And the strain on my wrists are minimal . Although it feels lightweight , it is really quite durable as I have had this keyboard for a while now .
  My first impression of this lens was that it was much smaller than the pictures make it out to be . Only about 3 inches long by 2 inches in diameter . But boy does it make your photos pop . I 've been reading a lot of reviews about the new Pentax K7 , considering upgrading from my K10D . But one review I read , criticized consumers for wasting time always upgrading their camera body , when what really matters is the glass . Well , I can say , that guy was right . I took the money I was going to use on a new body and spent it on 2 high quality lenses . One of them was this macro . I 'm not disappointed . It 's like my camera is brand new and my photographic abilities have been improved . I bought this lens for flowers and insects . It works amazingly . At times the focus does " hunt " a bit , but I think that 's my camera more than the lens . I was expecting tight , crisp , high detail close ups and that 's exactly what I 've been getting . I 've heard others say this makes a great portrait lens . Well , they 're right . I didn't know why until I gave it a shot . Because this lens is macro and has such shallow focus capabilities , it tends to throw the background into a very soft buttery bokeh . This makes your subject really jump out of the photo . The effect is subtle but very pleasing and your portraits will be much improved I promise . So this is a double duty lens and it works great for both . Add to that , it 's small and light and it 's easy to toss in the camera bag for when you need it . Someone else mentioned the focus action is a bit " crunchy " but I think they may have the focus clamp on . If you accidentally bump that to " on " position , it tried to hold the focus . You can still turn the focus ring though but it requires more effort and makes a slight grinding noise . Don't do this and you 'll be just fine .
  I saw these phones on Amazon for $ 20 right before Christmas , so I decided to give them a try . After plugging them in to my Samsung MP3 player , I was somewhat disappointed in the overall tonal balance , which seemed to lean toward the bright side . But after adjusting the custom EQ setting on the player - adding some bass , I must say that these phones don't sound too bad ! Would I recommend these ? Sure . Especially if your player has an adjustable EQ so you can dial in the sound the way you like it .
  Don't believe the picture ! This does NOT come in a Brother retail box , and the cartridges don't even have the Brother brand name on it . Looks like third-party ink , NOT BROTHER . Will be returning my order ! :(
  I love this case . Since my life is now run by my PDA I wanted more protection for it than the little cover that came with it . I can already see the protection it 's provided by the marks on the case . And I don't worry about it accidently being turned on while in my purse and running down the battery . It also makes it easier to locate in my purse . I have no complaints with the latch . It has never come open in my purse . The case has been dropped sereval times on the floor , it has sprung open but the latch is still intact .
  Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player ( Brown ) I bought a 30G Zune a year ago and loved the way I could have my music , pictures and videos with me always . I am a mother of 4 and a grandma of eight so I have LOTS of pics and flicks . I have about 1900 songs , 40 videos , and 212 pictures on my Zune right now with 14G to go . Two other family members bought Zunes through the year and it made it so nice to wirelessly share pictures with each other that I bought three more this Christmas as gifts for my husband , son , and sister . We are now a 6 Zune family and growing . We all love them and plan on buying more as the grandkids get older .
  Excellent unit , it is very compact , and the mounting was easier than standard door opener . I replaced a standard rail , belt drive door opener with this unit to maximize ceiling height for a car lift installation . This unit is so quiet and efficient , I plan on replacing the other garage door unit with this Jackshaft unit . The new electronic opener with clock , temp , and motion detector light , are just added bonus 's I was not expecting . I highly recommend this LifMaster and I am a throughly satisfied customer .
  I purchased this from a different online dealer that is has a very good reputation , but it was having light meter problems right out of the box and all of my negatives were either over / under exposed . To verify this , I took the camera with the 28-70 lens to a local camera repair shop and they verified my problems with the light meter and told me that the lens was underexposing as well . I tried to talk on the phone with the company that bought out vivitar but they wouldn't budge and kept me on hold for 40 min . Extremely rude customer service . When they came back they just kept telling me that they could do nothing even though I have a one year warrenty ! I finally got help through their email and sent everything back . Got a new camera and they fixed the lens ( maybe , I still think it is a little off ) free of charge . Avoid the hassle dont buy this camera kit . If you have the money get a nikon or canon , its a much safer bet even if used .
  Remote sending of video + audio + IR control is a good idea planned to be delivered by this artifact . Truth is interference degrades audio and renders video unusable from just 25 feet and one through-wall . Think twice before taking this solution because as 2.4 GHz band is crowded , 5.8 represents hope but performance is subject to a myriad of conditions .
  great sound - exceeded my expectations - I 'm planning to buy a second one for my other TV ..
  First thing I did with this remote is to try to control my XBox 360 . Out of the package , this remote runs VERY slowly on the XBox 360 . You press a button , the control lights up , and then about a half second later the command registers with the XBox . . . As you press the buttons , your commands also seem to queue up . So you hit the button a few times while its waiting to register for the first command , it then does your repeat presses in the order you hit them . But wait , you can change the timings ! Everyone and their mother is telling me to change the timings but of course , timings are set to their minimum for the XBox . Then someone told me on the logitech forums that I have to aim it better . . . this is a remote control . I shouldnt have to do anything other than point in the basic direction . These people want me to install a lazer sight on the damned thing . The TV setup was somewhat of a pain . I had to erase my entire configuration in order to use it . Then when I set up the TV and Cable activities , it seemed to create all its own inputs with the default names . I don't like that at all . . . it should be able to use the inputs that I define so my wife who won't use this control doesn't have to memorize that the DTV input is cable and Component 1 is DVD . Next , I can't just power on and off the TV . I have to hit some other button that is asking what activity I 'd like to use first . When I do this , it makes sure all of inputs are correct . So because of this , it takes like 7 seconds for my TV to turn on when I tell it to use the " Watch TV " activity . I can't figure out how to tell it that these inputs that it is checking won't change . . . Not to mention that when I did this , it seems to blip inputs and add a space to a movie I 'm recording because inputs from the cable box were set in the process . All I want to do is hit the power button . - Buttons : First , there are missing buttons . Where is the " List " or " On Demand " button ? Where is the sleep button ? PIP buttons ? There are more but you get the picture . Page up / down ? Guide ( Guide and Live were an afterthought thrown as words on the buttons you might use for the A / B / C buttons . They don't even work as guide and Live until you program them if you want to ) . How about the A B C buttons that have been on every cable remote that I 've seen in the past 8 years ? For buttons that don't exist , you can put them into the 4 buttons with paging on the LCD screen . That 's nice , but should I have to page over for buttons ? Luckily I was able to fit my buttons on unused things such as sleep on Star . The Live button also didn't work out of the box but I was able to fix it . The configuration utility is pretty confusing at first but it was doable . There are typos but I assume that is the mistake of the TV manufacturer . The LCD is a nice feature but it needs more buttons . - Timing : Ugh . . . why do I care about timing ? WHY ? Why can the manufacturer not provide the timing ? Setting timings is what you have to do when your remote responds too slowly for your items . Unfortunately , Im stuck with a slow XBox remote . . . this is ridiculous but true . My TV Volume control was too slow at first but I lowered the timings and it works fine . . . My settings were arbitrary and they worked . Guess I can't complain about more than having to set them in the first place . - Software : The software does not provide much info . For instance . When I go to timings and I see the " Start Time " or whatever it is . . . I want to know what that means . Most people think mousing over something like that should tell me but apparently not the people at logitech . I still don't know what it means though I did finally find a way to get the manual which does not come with the remote ( this is a good idea though because I dont like all the paper wasted on manuals ) . - For the money , Im not sure I 'd buy this remote . I got it as a gift and I did want it but after seeing some of the things about it , I kinda wish I just waited on this and bought something a little more sophisticated and comprehensive . For those who don't know , you can use ANY harmony remote for the XBox 360 . You don't need this thing . There might be more about this but I didn't even finish setting up the system . It took me a few hours to get just my TV set up with all the buttons and timings I want . I had to finally go to sleep . Luckily my sleep key worked . I was happy about that .
  First of all , they hardly worked at all on the scratches . Secondly , these drops ruined my iPod ! The liquid got inside of the clickwheel and messed up the electronics . I repeat , MY IPOD BROKE , AND NEVER WORKED AGAIN BECAUSE OF THESE . DO NOT BUY
  My daughter and her husband had been wanting a pressure cooker for some time after borrowing one from a friend . I had been pricing this same one on different web sites . They were always higher in price . And with free super saver shipping it was a no brainer . I received it within 2 days of ordering it . They love it and use it all time . It cooks so fast , they can cook a pot roast in less than a hour , meat comes out tender everytime . Thanks Amazon ! Another great purchase . Cindy from Gurnee
  There is absolutely no way this product is for a s13 240sx . Ive tried cutting , sanding , molding .. Not for this car . Im not 100 percent sure but I think the Metra 99-7407 is the right din for the s13 's .
  The capture software , Ad FullCap , requires a serial number different from the product ID # in order to open and run it . That number is not supplied in some packages , and you must e-mail tech support and wait for them to e-mail you back the number . Had there been any notice of this requirement , I would have e-mailed them before I wanted to capture video , instead of wasting the weekend I 'd cleared to do the the project .
  Recently installed this cartridge and it is not printing red correctly . All of the colors are " off ' . Disappointed , I am wondering what is wrong with this cartridge .
  I spent months trying to get the crappy company that sold me my zoom lense to help me figure out how to attach it to my camera . The pieces they sold me didn't work . Finally I went to Frys and they told me I needed a 37mm to 52mm ( I think those are the sizes ) adapter to fit between my lense and the tube that fits onto my camera . They didn't sell them so they referred me online and I found this Raynox ring . It works perfectly and I it arrived days before my cuise where I put the zoom lense to good use !
  I purchased this item to go with my Nikkor 50mm f / 1.8It works exactly as it should . I haven't used it much , but i mainly bought it to protect the lens .
  Its very light though note its size cause its definitely not the micro-sized superspy type monocular ! Only drawback is that since the non-eyepiece opening is only a ' medium-size ' not the larger size some monoculars have , this unit ' darkens ' the view slightly . So its not a great choice for use in real low-light conditions .
  Bought 2 of these because they were so cheap , but neither worked . Not worth returning them . Guess it 's true , you get what you pay for !
  The unit was delivered promptly . This mount works well and was easy to install .
  Purchased from Amazon on Dec . 27 , 2009 . Headphones no longer working as of July 21 , 2010 . Tried all fixes but none worked , they are just dead . I know they are an inexpensive headphone but I expected them to last more than 7 months . Can't get them fixed as it would cost more than a new pair . I think I 'll try another brand . Any suggestions ?
  Camera has good features and decent battery life for a " regular " camera . For those of you who don't need a special camera and just want something that can take decent pictures . This is a good one . I like it .
  I bought this product a while ago , and after several attempts to figure out how I can benefits from the anti-aging properties I 've given up . I tried to sleep with it under my pillow , shower with it , hang it around my neck while at work . NOTHING seems to work , I 'm still the exact same age as before ! I need to bring it back . Buyers beware , don't buy this to its anti-aging properties , it 's not work the money .
  Although a month and a spindle of disks have been trashed , I don't have it working yet . I 've just sent it back to ADS for repair . Seems that it starts okay in direct tape to disk but freezes on a video frame while the counter and audio continue working . At that time , the green capture light of the DX2 stops flashing and becomes steady and the DVD recorder stops burning . A program upgrade was installed , but the problem continued . Several calls to ADS Tech , when I could get them on the phone , offered the upgrade and blamed the problem on memory , but my 512 RAM had nothing else running except Norton Internet Security . So it went back for whatever ADS / Tech5 can find wrong with it . I haven't given up hope , yet !
  The case is perfect in all regards except one . The camera strap really doesn't fit through the opening but this is essentially a non issue as I wouldn't want to constrain the camera so much anyway .
  Seldom use this webcam , picture and sound system is not too good . Next time I buy a computer I 'll get the one that has a build inwebcam .
  This product is cheap / very affortabe . This is the pros . This is a positive credit for the seller . The seller shipped the product promptly . Another positive . But it is designed wrong on the angle interface - the cable will facing the OUT of the computer case for most of the hard drive mount so that the computers can not close the cover . The angle pins should be reversed so that it points inward toward the computer , not block the case cover . I swapped it with the DVD ROM cable which is internal .
  Installation under Windows XP on my Athlon XP notebook PC was a piece of cake . Remember , under XP you don't install the drivers using the utility that came w / the card . Instead , you plug in the PCMCIA card and XP will recognize it and request the location of the drivers . You can then put your Linksys CD in and browse for the driver . That is all there is to it . For card configuration , you use the wireless configuration tool in XP , not the Linksys app . Make sure you set up WEP , otherwise your network belongs to anyone w / in range . Range for any wireless card is not great . I live in an old house with thick , plaster walls - I get somewhere around 30 ft of range through multiple walls . I don't know anyone who gets the claimed 100 ft of WiFi range , or even half of that inside of a house . Still , no reason not to set up WEP . That is done through XPs wireless configuration utility as well . The card has 2 LEDs - one indicates it has power , the other a sync . But I have lost the signal completely and both LEDs still glowed . There is a firmware upgrade , which I have not applied . I am thinking I might leave well enough alone . It works . Don't expect wired performance . Wireless is great for internet connection sharing , but for file sharing I still prefer wires , for both speed and security .
  it was a fast shipping , good quality product but isn't what I need , I buy it by the picture , and the picture isn't from the product .. shame , waste of money .. and time ..
  I was very impressed with the price and the quality of this memory card for my digital camera ! Highly recommend !
  One of the reasons why I bought this product was that I thought it would look good stacked atop my apple TV . Sure enough , it does look good . But I also bought the product because I needed an HDMI switcher to use my Cable Box , PS3 and Apple TV through the same input . The product worked for about a week and then completely died ! It would not turn on , which after reading other reviews , seems to be a pattern . I called Xtreme HD support and , once I was able to actually get them to answer the phone , they were useless . There support dept . gave me a number to call ( fox media I believe ) who I was told deals with there warranties . I called that number and the support specialist told me that they are not the company to talk with , and to call another number . The number they gave me was for Memorex who , for some reason , does warranties for Xtreme HD . Since I did not have my proof of purchase ( deleted the email ) , I was told that I could not return the product and that I was simply out of luck . I will never buy another Xtreme HD product again .
  I have had my T / C for 8 months now . It has been a great handheld , but I wouldn't buy another , and wouldn't recommend anyone else buy one . The Good : Excellent thumb-board has led me to largely abandon use of the stylus . Fast processor , great screen , and WIFI mean you can actually surf the internet if you are near a hotspot ( but only if you buy WebProV , the included web browser is poor ) . I always synch with my wireless LAN rather then the cradle , because it is just as fast . The battery is huge ; I usually only charge the unit once a week , and I am a power user ; using it for hours every single day . The bad : construction quality is poor , and there is little quality control ( a " refurbished unit " I was sent arrived nonfunctional , with the case not snapped completely together ) . There is a class problem with LCD screens breaking with little or no torture to the unit ( this is my 4th PDA , and the first I have broken a screen on ) . The PLASTIC case creaks when you push it and the palm flexes ; the halves are not well fastened together ( which might cause the screen breakage ) . There is a gap at the bottom of the screen where the case does not touch the screen . The screen emits a high pitched 400 Hz hum , which has got steadily noisier the longer I have owned the product ( to the point where I can hear it at arms length ) . About 40 % of all palms developed a software glitch which caused the bottom 20-30 pixels of the digitizer to fail after a few months of use ( possibly corrected with a new firmwear upgrade this month ) . The silver paint on the case scratches and wears off easily . The headphone jack is a 2.5 mm mono jack for use with a headset to allow for future VOIP , unfortunately , standard cell phone headsets will not work , as they swapped the connection terminal order on the jack . The Ugly : Palm customer service . I paid $ 40 for an advanced exchange to fix the problem with my digitizer ( covered under warranty ) . It was very painful : 1 defective advanced exchange , 1 promised advanced exchange that never happened , 1 advanced exchange shipped to the wrong address , 2 more promises of advanced exchanges that did not occur , 1 attempt to charge me an additional $ 40 for another advanced exchange , 3 emails threatening charges to my credit card of $ 550 weeks after tracking info on airborne express website indicated Palm had received the returned handhelds at least 7 days prior , 2 promises ( not fulfilled ) to charge back my credit card the $ 40 due to poor service , 7 long distance phone calls totalling 129 minutes . Every call to Palm was the start of a brand new conversation : their system of keeping track of customers does not work . And 2 weeks after I finally got a functional T / C , the screen broke ( and I hadn't even dropped it ) . My advice ? As a user of both palmOS and PPC , I prefer the palmOS ( as long as it has a high-res screen and a fast processor ) . I am not a fan of their construction quality or customer service process . If you need a keyboard ( and I do ) , buy a Sony UX . If you want a good screen , buy a sony TH55 . Stay away from Palm T3 and T / C.
  I was really looking forward to using this item when I ordered it . What arrived was not a VP2130b , but rather an N2201w LCD TV with built in DVD player ( with a selling price of about $ 400 ) . When I contacted Amazon , they offered to let me keep the ' item with slight damage ' ( their description , not mine ) and offered me a refund of $ 122 ( lowering my cost at that point to $ 477 ) . I declined as graciously as I could and canceled the order .
  I grew tired of the usual drip coffee maker and this percolator makes me fall in love with coffee again . Pros : - Coffee has more body and depth . - Great for making a 3-cup afternoon pick-me-up . - Compact , doesn't take a lot of space on the counter . Cons : - Cleaning takes a bit more time-Coffee grind at the end of brewing cycle . Have to pour gently and leave a little coffee in the pot to avoid the grind . - Available reusable nylon filters do not fit the 6-cup percolator ( too big ) . Had to return one and do not want to use paper filter either ( no more paper in my coffee ) .
  i would defiantly recommend buying a zen over an ipod . a zen has everything an ipod has plus more and its cheaper .
  What a disappointment when Christmas morning my son started to set up the Ceiva 3 only to find that it would cost another 159.95 per year to make it work . We went back to the box looking in disbelief that we had missed this important information . BUT THE ADDITIONAL COST IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND . It says " free " but no mention of the additional 99.95 to 159.95 needed to use their product . Such deception should not be allowed by companies who use Amazon to sell their products . We are sending this item back . If they deceived us once , how can they be trusted ? Shame on Ceiva ! I will never again fail to read the reviews BEFORE I BUY .
  I followed the directions for setting up with a USB connection and all functions worked flawlessly . There seems to be some confusion on how to use an external telephone answering machine . I connected the external answering machine as described in the drawing . Then I set the FAX mode to manual as described on page 4-1 of the manual . The machine is set by default to answer the phone when it receives the FAX beeping sound from the other end . With this combination , if the incoming call is a voice type , the answering machine answers in the usual way and the FAX machine does not disturb it . If the incoming call is a FAX type , the answering machine answers but the FAX beeping signals activate the FAX machine to receive and it cuts off the telephone answering machine . All in all a satisfactory situation for myself who receives very few FAX transmissions . The unit goes into hibernate when nothing is happening and draws 10 W of power from the line . If you want to save even more energy you can turn the power switch off but the date and time are lost after a few days . I intentionally bought this refurbished version because they have better reliability than new ones . All of the early failures have been found and fixed . You are saved the bother of shipping a defective unit back to the repair station . I especially like the way all functions are run by keys on the unit . On the scan you have several choices for storage of the results . The OCR mode has some problems . When scanning the printout of an email , it missed several strings of asterisks used as separators between text sections . When scanning a legal document with signatures it got confused around the signatures and reformatted the text and made spelling errors . However correcting them was faster than retyping the whole document .
  I bought this unit to track how far I travel while walking . Thefirst unit received had bad segments in the LCD . Amazonquickly sent another unit that did appear to work . This unit takes a long time to find sattelites . Several timesit never found ANY , under clear blue sky . It just turned offafter 10 minutes . It would lose signal frequently . The deal breaker is that when it loses sattelites , it will not accountfor distance during the lost signal . Lets say you are walking / running , and the unit is logging distance . For a 10th of a mile , it losessattelite . When it gets sattelite back , it starts loggingagain from the new point . But it does NOT add the distanceyou traveled while the signal was missing . As if I teleportedto the new location . Useless .
  A friend of mine had one of these in college and I envied him . We would take it to the beach , use it for parties . It has a great sound and is a solid device ! So when I saw one reasonably priced , used , on Amazon I jumped on it . I love this thing . Best part is , there 's an auxillary input so you can hook you Ipad into , laptop , etc . Great Buy ! Highly recommended !
  I bought this printer ( not free like it is now , but was $ at the time ) for our mother when this first was introduced . We have used it ever since as a means to send her photos or cut-n-paste items from the Internet since she just cannot access a computer without difficulty . At any other time over these years I would have given this solution a 5 star rating . Even though we quickly learned to not use any of the ' free ' ( nothing really is free ) downloads like puzzles etc since they suck the expensive ink cartridges dry , the product still delivered what we were mostly looking for at the time . At $ 99 / yr it seemed worth it . At $ 149 a year it is not . And not only that , people can use a code to get a free printer so all of us who have been customers since the first days not only have a printer we paid a lot of $ for originally that is truly worth NOTHING now , we also have gotten hit with a 50 % service increase . So after all of these years it was decided not to renew the service in early December . Our mother gave the final thumb down to the idea .
  just the thing to play my old 78s , and its got enough torque to make cleaning the dirty little buggers easy too .
  The quality of this bag is just great the problem could be the very tiny front bag . It also has a small bag for the AC power cable and transformer but once you use it there is no place to put it comfortably considering a 15 " laptop .
  On the plus side : 1 . This cassette adapter works in my Passat 's stereo , unlike the Sony adapter , which did not . 2 . Sound quality and usability are both better than the iTrip . One the minus side : 1 . The sound quality is miserable . Bass is almost totally missing . The midrange dominates , and most of the high end is muted . This problem is so bad that adjusting bass / midrange / treble on my stereo cannot compensate . For reference , actual cassettes sound great in this same stereo . 2 . This cassette adapter has gears in it that make both spindles turn when one is turning . This is probably what makes it work in my stereo , however it does make some sound . The end result is some mechanical noise that gets in the way of quiet parts of the music .
  I 've owned this for a month now and I 'm thrilled . This power supply is outstanding for what I use it for ( R / C Hobbies ) . Maybe a bit of overkill until I get into charging larger battery packs . It 's a bit hefty ( 23 pounds ) for transport to and from a track , but it handles everything I throw at it and stays cool without a lot of noise . It accepts the banana plugs from my charger so I don't have to mess with wrapping bare wire . Keep in mind if you need to supply something less than 12V , you may want to go with it 's little brother the PS26KX which still provides 22-25 AMPs and adjusts from 6-15V . Overall , I highly recommend this power supply over smaller ( < 20AMP ) systems that many R / C stores try to push on people . I little bit more money will save a lot of headaches .
  This is the second one that I 've purchased as a gift . Very easy to use and great value for price .
  Great price for this cable to connect my Sony Hi8 Camcorder to my Tivo to transfter some old analog videos to my Tivo DVR . Great value !
  . I agree with " Kman " and " Zombiecrow 's " descriptions . I also am driving them with the Yamaha 5690 receiver . One thing I do recommend is that you buy heavier wire . The included wire is only # 24 and doesn't look like it will do the job adequately . You can get 100 feet of # 16 wire for about $ 20 . Unless you have a large room , that should be enough . I have not noticed a problem with the bass ; perhaps the heavier wire did the trick . To demonstrate the system for friends , I put on the DVD " Gettysburg " and play the final bombardment just before Pickett 's charge . Sounds like you are right in the middle of the Confederate cannons . I adjusted the subwoofer with the manual adjustment on the back to the bass fiddle in a jazz concert DVD . That gave just enough bass . I adjusted the other speakers first using the auto setup with the included microphone . It did an OK job , but I found adjusting them individually with the manual feature made them closer to my personal preference .
  The reason for buying this is to replace the exact same one the was stolen from our car . We have had other ones .. itrip , etc .. but they have problems getting washed out by local stations . This one can automatically screen for the best chanels making the job easier , and it can also go into the 87 's , below most transmitters making it great for long drives . My son loves the replacement so I actually bought an additional one for my other son with the same degree of success . If you can keep your kids from complaining about a product , that is a degree of product success . It also has more broadcast power than other units so that helps it maintain a good signal . Label this review as buying what works !
  The sub has been hooked to my system for about 4 weeks . I am very satisfied with it . Fast shipping .
  I just purchased these radios for my family and they work really well ! The ergonomics are well thought out , they fit into our kids ' hands easily , and they are completely simple to operate and fun to use . I 'd recommend this pair for any family . The clarity of the transmission is exceptional . They also have eliminator codes that help keep out other spurious conversations . The kids especially like the different call tones to signal the other radio . No complaints on this end ! Enjoy !
  The cover over the spindle was busted and several of the CD 's were broken . Very disappointed because the box they were shipped in was fine so they must have been packed that way .
  This little machine does a great job for very little cost . We have tried call notes and other machines but with the features it offers there is none better . The call announce allows us to screen calls without getting up .
  I received this product ( See customer photos ) . It is not original like the photo ! . Do not waste your money ! . Very disappointed !
  I could never make it work . Lost my money . Low quality .. You better look for other options .
  Original review 9/11/12 : This item is perfect for my situation . I am a fairly heavy person of average height . The pad fits my back and is the right height . It does smash down about half way when I fully lean against it . But at this point that is OK . In fact , since it has so much give to it , it does not feel like you have a lump in the middle of your back - it feels more natural . And most times I am not pushing against it that hard . If the mesh were to loosen more over time I could put something between it and the chair . So far it is fine the way it is . You can't beat the price , and it shipped the same day I ordered it . Update 11/5/12 : I have been using this support daily for 2 months . It has not collapsed or loosened , and still provides the same level of support . My back no longer aches .
  I only got a strong signal with 2 Macs for about 10 ' with the Netgear MR 814 . Also Netgear does not provide the 24/7 tollfree tech support they advertise if you have an Apple setup . I cannot recommend this for folks with Macs who want to share a Cable connection .
  Still going strong after 10 years , amazing ! We use it often and at times very heavily . Have been using generic ink from Amazon for years with no problems and this thing never has a paper jam . Hope my next one does as well .
  They can't support this properly - beware . A simple question on how to connect this wirelessly they can't provide help . They then actually had the nerve to tell me to seek support from the retailer ! Beware .
  After reading the other reviews I was concern about the scanner , however , my time and buget was limited and I had a lot of cards to input . So , I decided to give the scanner a try . I was pleasantly confirmed that I made the right choice . It does have problems recognizing hand written cards and fancy font - which is good for me to know about my own business cards , however , it 's real easy to fix when adding notes about my new business associates . Overall , I really like my scanner , I found the whole system easy to install , the program user friendly , and the set up quick to start scanning - about 5 - 10 minutes . I was able to scan 50 cards , add notes and edit recognition issues within minutes - about 15 . Hope this helps !
  Worked fine when I first got it , the fan wasn't loud as other reviewers described and it was simple to put together . But the computer stopped recognizing the drive after 40 days , I swapped drives to ensure it wasn't the dvd-drive itself , but the enclosure wouldn't work with any drive I put in it . Unfortunately , it 's so cheap , it 's not even worth going to the manufacturer to warranty . Easier to pick up a new one ( not a Nexstar ) . Unfortunately , I can't recommend the brand or drive because it didn't even last one year .
  I bought this for my Mom . Broke after warranty period , bought second one at reduced rate . Broke again due to power supply , Broke again - pictures would not download . Cieva recommended another power supply . New power supply faulty . This product is a great idea , but due to poor quality it is a MONEY PIT .
  First let me say that I am a computer expert . I have been using Vista since the beta version , and I actually like it . I have also been testing Windows 7 , which is similar to Vista , but is supposed to need less computer resources and be MORE compatible . I love this printer on Vista with a USB connection . The network connection was a bit slow but the USB was great . The colors are incredible for a laser printer . I am a Realtor and do a LOT of printing . With this printer I can print my own fliers , which saves on printing costs . I 've owned the printer less than a year . HP has no intention of supporting this printer on Windows 7 64bit . So , now that I 've spent hours upgradding my main computer , not to mention hundreds of dollars for Windows 7 , I 've learned that my best printer is NOT compatible . So - if you are considering this printer , and there is any chance that you will be converting to Windows 7 - forget it , look elsewhere . By the way AMAZON is awesome - this is NO reflection on them . I am very angry with HP who has decided NOT to write Windows 7 drivers . If you are sticking with Vista or XP then this is a great printer .
  The card work the first two or three times I used it . Then it stopped working . I can't read or write to it anymore .
  This digital voice recorder was a bust - and Sony should be whipped for marketing it . The sound quality was semi-clear on a voice test , but in action it failed big time - even when subject to be recorded was 2 feet away ! Don't even think about it - some things you can buy because you trust the brand , but this one I 'm out the $ 79 and change . yuk
  After setting up the printer ( which is very simple ) , it was put to work . It worked fine in scanning , copying , and printing . Then 48 hours went by .. it no longer wanted to work for printing . Hmm , that 's not good . Pros : shiny / flashy buttons . Scans to PDF ( except if using top tray ) Cons : printing fails after no more than 30 hours of use note : 30 hours of plug-in time , not 30 hours of printing ) . The other reviews are pretty accurate ( except the ones that say this is a good product ) . Other thoughts : Shame this one doesn't work . I 've been an HP loyalist since 1995 , using several different models . It 's frustrating that the older HP printers work better than this newer version and are more reliable . Gone are the days , perhaps , when printers lasted at least four years .. seems they ( HP ) want people to buy a new printer every month . Disappointing , cheap , won't make coffee ( or prints ) . In short : Buy at your own risk , and expect it to stop working as you want , when you don't want , and you 'll end up throwing it off a great height , or use it as a weight of some sort .
  I bought a QPS back in April , I had configuration issues right away . I followed the tech support format and emailed them . Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers . They do not respond through support . Now the hardware failed , I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes . No 1-800 number . Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also . Please don't allow companies like this to thrive , which they all too commonly do in todays market . Buy elsewhere .
  I really enjoy this product . Very well made and display is very clear . Easy to use and great value for the money . The thing I like the most is the sound quality . It is just great ! The WOW option to enhance the sound is very good and the subwoofer control as well . The only thing I miss is an USB entry in the front panel , but for the rest it is perfect .
  I 'm sure this is a fine product , but it died in less than two weeks
  Live TVPeople mention the problems with the TIVO not being designed to turn off . For my purposes though the problem is that the recording of Live TV can not be turned off . This records up to 30 minutes of whatever channel is on . This happens 24hours a day . I tested the electricity use and it is 25 watts ( kilo ? ) . At night the only thing that can compete with this is our fridge or humidifier but they are doing something useful . It is probably much larger than the sum of all the little things you have going on in the house ( phones charging , clocks , all the glowing LED 's .. ) . Plus there is the wear on hard drive and the noise . RecommendationsI never found the recommendations useful . They seem mostly genre based . For example , if you like the Office then you must like other sitcoms so you get Will and Grace and Scrubs . If you like lost then you 'll like any show with islands or aliens . For our watching it didn't turn out this way . We like Lost and the Office because ( in our opinion ) they 're good not because they are in a genre . TIVO doesn't seem to be able to match us up with other people that have an overall similar taste . The good stuffIt 's very easy to use . It runs itself . There are a staple of shows and a wishlist or two which keep it so there is always something to watch .
  It works as expected . I installed this black on white tape on a Brother P-Touch Model PT-80 . The PT-80 labeler is not available anymore , so I was happy to see that the tape is still available . I am very happy .
  Believe those unfavorable comments about freeze , hang-up , and others ! System would freeze completely . You 'd have to unplug the system to reset to get your disk out . What is most ridiculous thing is Apex 's customer service : it would take you at least 30 minutes on hold before picking up the phone . And , instead of providing you any help on the phone , I guessed the only service they provide is to ask you to return the item for exchange . The operator does not know anything , zip , about the product and the problem ! Don't waste your time ( for transit ) and money ( return shipping and insurance . ) And don't listen to those favorable comments . It & iexcl ; s probably an INSIDE job . Never have had problem with Amazon 's order before , and this is the first time . Now I am having reserve when ordering from Amazon again . Kind of surprised that Amazon would place its reputation with such low quality product and supplier !
  I just love my Nikon Coolpix 3100 ! It does everything it says it should and I have had no problems with it . I was able to buy a large memory card for fairly cheap and have been taking tons of pictures ever since the day I bought it . We used to have a Kodak Easyshare , and to tell you the truth , my husband never saw what was easy about it . Perhaps it was too easy ! This little camera takes great pictures , the zoom is just right . I would suggest this camera to anyone who just wants it for nice family and friends candids .
  I 'd give this a 1 star only because it can't go any lower . Bought this router about 6 months ago . First month or so worked great , then I started to get dropped signals every few days or so and have had to unplug / replug the power cord just to get a signal again . Then it gets worse and worse .. now I lose the signal daily and have to power cycle it at least once a day , sometimes 3 or more ! Worse , the signal comes in and out when it says " connected " on my computer . Been talking to tech support and customer service for the last 2 months . Finally , tech support told me that they 'd replace my router for me at no cost to me , and would even have someone pick up my old , defective router so that I do not have to pay for the shipping of the old router back to them . In order to do so , I had to call customer service for arrangements . To my surprise ( and my waste of time ) customer service coldly said that it 's company policy that I pay the shipping for the routers . I agreed to settle the issue through replacement because I don't have to pay for the shipping and that since I will supposedly receive the new router first , I will not have any down time not having a connection at home . This was agreed upon with tech support , and customer service decides to change that ? Isn't there some sort of credibility with company promises and first-decisions ? I know it 's their company policy that I pay shipping to send my defective router back to them , but since their techician told me otherwise , should they not also honor the exception ? Sigh , I don't think I can take this any more . I 'm going crazy . Do not buy from Linksys . They suck , they really do .
  Ink cartridge runs out fast . I wish they use a bigger cartrige for the printer .
  The picture you get from this monitor is better than the Dell monitor , photos just look sharper and the color is better . It only has one DVI input . Be very careful when you purchase a DVI cable for this monitor ( the one it comes with is about three feet long ! ) you must get the DVI-I or something like that . If you get the other DVI cable it will not fit . Overall it is a good monitor and gives excellent quality right out of the box .
  Solid construction . Not sure I can tell the difference yet for this Cat6 vs the Cat5e cable I had lying around , but certainly nothing wrong with this .
  Well what can i say , it 's a foam piece of goodness and very lightweight . I have a 14.1 inch laptop and it fits it perfectly and the foam grips it well . I was having overheating problems with my laptop and had 2 hard drive crashes before i finally realized it was due to overheating problems . Before i ordered this i had to prop my laptop up on a book or something to keep the bottom ventilated because it only has one fan . The product itself doesn't have any fans on it of course , but it does a great job of keeping laptops elevated to let air pass through . I also set my BIOS settings to run the cpu fan all the time when the AC adapter is plugged in and i run the SpeedFan app to keep track of my temperatures and all is well ! * I 'm giving hints and tips here people ! LoL * I don't recommend it for larger laptops because as said it is kind of small . I have a 14.1 inch screen and it doesn't even cover the whole bottom of my laptop . I only gave it 4 stars because IMO they should have included a couple of velcro strips to mount it to the bottom of the laptop , that would have been a plus ! But i 'm going to do that myself = - ) . Definately worth the [ .. ] bucks i paid for it though !
  Absolutely terrible tech support , comes with zero usuable maps , took me 6 hours and 4 attempts with tech support to download maps . May have been my computer Microsoft Vista , but still 6 hours .
  We can't use this because it dosen't have the support for the Nano 5 . The hole is on the wrong side . If the IPod got pushed too hard , it would break off the plug . Very dissappointing .
  I own two of these and they work GREAT . I 've used them with the 30D , 5DmII , and G10 . It works great . At least 19 out of 20 shots are flawlessly exposed . ( That 's better than I 've experienced with Canon OEM flashes . ) Apparently the other person to review this here on Amazon ( only one other review at the time of this writing ) didn't consider that his unit may have been defective . I bought this when I worked at Ritz camera ( Quantaray is their store brand ; I haven't worked there in a long time and I am proud to say I do not represent them in any way ) and I never heard any customer complaints about it . Ted 's 1 star review seems quite ridiculous . The combination of this module and a Quantaray or Promaster ( same thing , just that the Q line are rebadged for sale at Ritz Camera ) produces amazing results at a tiny fraction of the price of a Canon-brand flash .
  DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE ! This mouse has given me nothing but frustration . 1 . The front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low , causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time . 2 . Battery life is horrible . Like 2 weeks .. 3 . When your mouse is idle for 8 minutes , it goes into an automatic sleep mode . The manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to " revive " it but when I do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen . So I have to reboot my computer . Absolutely the worst !
  Works well for paintball . Cut holes to reach the buttons and to attached the lens . Good way to protect camera while shooting .
  I 'll be short simple an to the key points here .. NOT A SONY BULB ! Don't be fooled or mislead . It 's similar in look feel fit and performance but it 's clearly NOT a Sony bulb . Sure it costs a fraction of the price of the SONY version but don't be mislead .. Performance and build are from what i 've seen better than alot of the other knock off 's and copy cat 's out there but you will know when comparing side by side , it 's not a SONY bulb .
  After shopping around for a few months I bought these speakers at Best Buy , for $ 99 + tax , to use with Adobe Premiere . At first I was unimpressed , then I went into my computer settings and adjusted the EQ , now they sound great ! I am very happy with these speakers but if I had one complaint it would be the lack of shielding on the RCA to 1/8 " cable , that goes from the right speaker to the computer . If you don't keep it away from other cables you may get some interference hum , however I 'm not sure any other system would have anything better . My wife and I love the sound of these speakers so much we are going to buy another pair to use with our family room tv . FYI - These are not a flat sounding speaker , would not recommend for editing / recording music , yet great for listening to already mastered music .
  I have two pairs of these speakers . One set hooked up to my PC and one set hooked up to my PS3 and Xbox 360 . If you hate having to deal with a subwoofer or just dont want the kind of bass that makes the neighbors or parents mad , but you love deep bass , than these are your speakers . From CS source to WoW to UT3 on the PC . Or Battlefield BC2 ( war tapes ) to COD Modern Warfare 2 to Need for Speed Shift on the Xbox 360 . Or even Final Fantasy 13 to Motorstorm to KillZone 2 to Tekken 6 to God of War 3 on Playstation 3 . These speakers do amazing things to these games and so many more . Nothing can describe how awesome these speakers are in war tapes sound mode on BC2 . The bass in these speakers are just right . From explosions , to gun shots even footsteps are well done . They dont overkill on the small stuff ( foot steps ) , but are just right on the big stuff ( explosions ) ! They perform just as well with music and blu ray movies . I watched 300 using these speakers , one word came to my mind - Amazing . Perfect speakers at the right price .. Subwoofer sound , without the sub !
  I 've got the " non-talking " version of this scope , but I thought I 'd post this here , too , since everything else is the same .. Everything bad you 've read in the other reviews is all 100 % true . From the lack of tracking , poor go-to ( because it doesn't keep the time after you 've set it ) , to the way over exaggerated magnification claims , shaky mount - all true . I 've had one of these scopes for about 4-5 years ( got it as a gift ) . I used it once or twice but couldn't do anything but look at the moon with it . It went in the attic ( where most cheap scopes end up ) after a short time .. Then I gave it to my sister ( she kept it when I moved - I was going to throw it away ) . She gave it back after about a year because she couldn't get it to focus . Only useful for the moon she says ( couldn't get the computer to work at all - her fault there - read on ) . Since that time , however , I learned a lot about telescopes in general . So when I got it back , I figured out why it wouldn't focus with the included 4mm eyepiece or the supplied 3x barlow . It was WAY out of collimation . Collimation wasn't even mentioned in the manual at all . They assume it is always in collimation . If a scope gets out of collimation it is useless so it is strange not to put it in the manual at all . So I take out the primary mirror and mark the center spot with a red sharpie ( you need to mark the center of the primary mirror for collimation - this one doesn't come pre-marked ) . I put it back in and use a cheshire eyepiece ( used for collimation ) to line up the optics . Now I knew why there were no instructions on collimating . This thing is almost impossible to collimate ! The secondary mirror basically falls out when you loosen any ONE of the set screws ! Anyway after about an hour and fifteen minutes I got it in very good collimation . However , even in good collimation , the 4mm eyepiece will not come into a sharp focus and NOTHING in the 3x barlow will come to focus AT ALL . This is definitely due to very , very poor quality of the supplied eyepieces . I 've tried other eyepieces which make this scope perform much better so I know it is the eyepieces . The 3x barlow is 100 % useless and it is also 100 % plastic ( I think it even has a plastic lens ) . The * only * reason the barlow is in the box is so they can advertise 525x magnification ( 700mm / 4mm * 3 for the barlow = 525x ) . But the useful magnification for any scope maxes out around 60x the aperture ( in inches ) . In this scope 's case that is 180x . The computer works like it is supposed to ( except it doesn't keep the time once you enter it which makes it pretty useless ) . The problem with the computer and " go-to " in general is the user has to know a bit about the sky before it is useful because you have to line up the scope manually on two stars to set the computer . The novice probably can't do this properly . Note , too , that the second star must be found fairly quickly after the first or the settings won't be very accurate ( hard , again , for the novice ) . The most useful part of the computer is using the direction arrows to manually keep an object in view since they slew the scope at a fairly slow rate . So , the user should know a bit about the night sky before attempting to ever use ANY go-to system . First of all , the best way to do that is to buy NightWatch : A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe ( Spiralbound ) by Terence Dickinson . That 'll get you oriented in the night sky and give a good starting point . Second , pick up a good starter scope . A good starter Newtonian ( same style as this scope ) with an object locator ( doesn't automatically move the telescope , though ) is an Orion SkyQuest XT6 . It has twice the aperture of this scope . If you get the XT6 without the intelliscope option it is even cheaper . General rule is buy the bigest aperture scope that your budget allows . Personally , I don't think you need a go-to at first . It is much more fun to be able to read start charts and star hop your way to find those deep sky objects . Very much like the difference between watching a movie vs . reading the book .
  Massive storage capacity ! My old original 30GB hard drive died on me . This replacement was the best option for me . I am a graphic artist & an amateur photographer . The need for more hard drive space needs no further explaining . Extremely inexpensive and easy to install , just unplug the old one and plug in the new one and presto ! Start loading it up !
  .. i 'm not sure about the clicking noises , but HD has annoying hum . it 's so annoying that i 'm seriously thinking about spending money on another HD . not that i need more space , but i need more silence . i 've had this HD for a week . hopefully it doesn't die before i get another HD .
  From what I have listened to in the computer audio market , there are two kinds of speakers . Those that focus on power with a sacrifice in fidelity ( gaming type systems ) and those that focus on fidelity while losing power ( music type systems ) . These are a shining example of the latter . They have a wonderfully transparent sound to them , very articulate and airy . These are the most detailed computer speakers I have ever heard . They are better than the vaunted Klipsh Promedia Ultra 's IMO . This set also has one of the punchiest subs on the PC market . Of course , it doesn't hold a candle to a true home stereo sub , it is still sharper and tighter than even the Klipsch subs . However , it is not capable of the klipsch 's output . The system itself is very elegant and has a wonderful piano finish that is very upscale looking . Bottom line , for $ 150 street value , these are a steal . If you are an audiophile who values clarity , balance and nuance over output , it is very hard to do better than these .
  i opened the box and there were more wires and cables than i knew what to do with ! the directions were very very poor and i had a difficult time knowing how to set it up . i did finally figure it out . the transmitter has to be plugged in ( fine ) . the speakers have to be plugged in ( okay .. ) and to get both speakers to play they have to be connected by speaker wire ( not okay ) . didn't meet my needs to be able to move one to one room and one to another room . the sound was great but not a wireless product by my definition . returned them .
  Got the usual excellent turnaround from Adorams ( 3 days ) . Remote is exactly what it says . Works great out of the box . Easy to keep in pocket for use when needed . Only down side is that it is so compact it would be easy to misplace ( not unlike the SD memory cards ) . It does have a little carry case , so that helps . Can't beat this for the money . I 'm surprised there are much more expensive remotes listed for the camera . Can't see what the use would be . Highly recommended .
  I bought this to replace a Canon UV filter that rolled down a mountain . Yesterday I was at Lake Louise taking pictures outside of beautiful scenery only to find that this Tiffen filter created a problem where there were reflections of the lens and adapter for the filter on my pictures ! The reflection problem was sometimes just an extra smudge on the bottom - but very obvious and pretty bad . It was worst in very bright conditions . I am going to order the Canon filter again . The problem was not that I had any condensation or smudges on my filter , because I had cleaned it off that morning . Given that most of my pictures are with lots of light / outside , this is useless to me and I regret bringing it with me . I will finish this trip out without this filter .
  I have been an avid photographer for 30 years mostly using a 35mm SLR . I also carry a 35mm Nikon point and shoot . I thought a digital camera would be fun but really didn't expect too much from it in terms of quality images . Before buying this unit I read every review I could find on several models and ultimately settled on this one . I have to say that I am surprized and delighted with the capabilities of this camera . Accessing the menus is simple , the controls are easy to use and the pictures are terrific . The camera rests comfortably in your hand with the zoom control handy to your right thumb . To make sure I wouldn't run low on power , I bought 2 sets of Ni-MH batteries and a charger the same day I got the camera . I take nearly every shot with the display turned off and I don't have a single complaint about battery life . Since I started looking for a digital camera , I have been paying more attention to other people using theirs ' and I can't believe how many people use the display when they are shooting pictures . No wonder the batteries run low ! Personally , I can't see how they can take pictures like that .. well I guess people like the gadgetry . The software is pretty basic but it installed without a hitch and seems to work perfectly . As far as a reliable , easy to use point and shoot digital camera , I think this one is great ! I also think that some of my older stuff may be collecting a bit of dust except for the most demanding tasks .
  I took it back after a few minutes . For a cam that costs $ 50 , both the SOUND and VIDEO quality was terrible and grainy . I installed it correctly and I use Windows XP . Should have no problem but it was a major disappointment . .. the CREATIVE LIVE ! CAM which was only $ 29 works a LOT better . Bottom line-Mcrosoft LifeCam VX-3000 has both BAD PICTURES , and BAD SOUND . You have been warned .
  This device ( both models ) is a total piece of junk . Be warned . Do NOT purchase this piece of crap . It isn't worth anything unless you like frustration and an expensive paper weight . Look elsewhere .
  I got these to replace my 4 yr old Senn px 100 which suddenly got broken at the miniplug , these are not as comfortable as the Px 100 but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just $ 5.00 i could not pass them up . They 're also very sensitive which makes them ideal for Ipods and other portable devices .
  This CD player was a gift for my child . She really liked it and liked the headphones that were included . They were very comfortable unlike products with earbuds . The website needs to include the headphones in the description . I couldn't find any reference to them and took a chance that this CD player would come with them .
  I bought this product to one of my best friend . I bought it as a gift , he is really happy about it and he is recommending this product . He is very pleased about it .
  For the price of this unit , I was a bit skeptical that it would do a good job . Recently , I bought an $ 80 unit at C. City and returned it within two days because : 1 ) even with a good " static " station , the quality of the music coming through was average at best , and I had to keep finding new stations to make it happy , even driving in the same town 2 ) I had to completely " disrobe " my ipod from its skin to play it in that model ( it was the kind that you have to clip it directly into a fastener which remains down by the cigarette lighter . ) Disrobing the skin from my ipod was inconvenient for me because I also use it regularly in the gym and need its skin to keep it protected , as well as clipped to my pants . Knowing these things , I knew I wanted to find a model that would accomodate the ipod skin as well as do a good job of playing on my car stereo . I was not disappointed with this Kensington . This design fits great w / the ipod skin , just like the regular USB cable you use to attach it to your computer . Also , the sound quality far exceeds the pricier model I had purchased earlier . I found one radio station and never had to change it - - the sound quality was fantastic - it was very similar to the same quality you get when you listen to a CD.I also was much happier with this model because it is much easier to see in the car - - the models that clip down by the cigarette lighter make it impossible to change the music while driving ( which of course , I only recommend doing at a red light or while stopped . :) Overall , I was very pleasantly surprised and delighted to find just what I had been looking for - - all at a very reasonable price !
  Well I 'd ordered before , had a great deal on cartridges About # 24.00 as I remember .. Couldn't remember the dealer tho ' .. so this time ordered and paid $ 14.00 for similar cartridges .. two of them clogged already .. right out of the box . Better buy " better " cartridges .
  Great sound , but the cord is too short , even if you use an MP3 player on an armband . If you turn your head while exercising , you will pull the left ear bud right out . The right one has a longer cord and will hold . They do give you an extension cord , but it is too long and the connection point is too heavy . The excess weight will also pull on the earbuds and the left one ( with the shortest slack ) will come out . On a five-mile ride / run I had to readjust this set several times . If not for the amazing sound , I would have given this product just one star . It would be a good set of headphones if you listen to music while lounging indoors .
  This product basically does what it 's supposed to do .. however - it also occasionally does strange actions , has to have cabling disconnected and reconnected to work again , and has an annoying " beep " that cannot be turned off . Sounds like I don't like it , eh ? Well , despite these drawbacks , it works well for the most part ( 97 + % of the time ) , making my life between work and home easier by saving all that space on my home office desk . So .. I can recommend it , but with the above drawbacks . If anyone knows of a better product or an update for this one , please let me know !
  It worked .. I used this flat cable to connect my Dish satellite to the receiver in the basement , through the window .. Be a little careful when you open / close the window . Amazing . ThanhPhan
  I bought this backpack for travel / vacation purposes . It worked out great ; the bag is not too small , and not too big . I was suprised how many lens and accessories I could jam in here . I put my Rebel XT w / Tamron 28-75mm lens . I also put 3 additional lens in the bag : Canon 28-135 IS , 17-55mm , and a 50mm . Oh , and a 430 flash ! That was all fitted in the bottom section only . You still have plenty of room up top , for accessories , CF card , lens cleaning kit , etc . Also , it came in handy as a shopping bag ! Of course , I didn't carry all lenses with me at all times , just the ones I was gonna use that day . The bag is very comfortable to wear , due to the fact that the shoulder pads were made of gel . All in all , it was a very balance backback , that was versatile , and looks great too . The only negative thing I have to say about this backpack , is that , if you want to get to your camera in an instant , forget it . You have to take of the bag , set it down somewhere , then unclip and unzipper it before you can get you camera out . Then again , your camera is very safe in here , and if you want fast access , get a sling backpack , or wear the camera around you neck !
  When I found this mouse in a store for the first time , I thought it seemed to fit my hand without sampling . I decided to purchase amazon . com and got it , however , the quality was cheaper than the looks in the package . The worst thing is that it is hard to move a mouse pointer . The amount of the moving of the pointer is very short per one movement even though I changed to max to the movement of the pointer in control panel .

  I purchased the Brother MFC-440cn with high hopes after reading several positive reviews . Unfortunately , I have been extremely disappointed with the purchase . The print quality is only mediocre , even on the " best " settings . The paper handling is awkward and inefficient . The default print settings are nearly impossible to locate and change . Most disappointing of all is the fact that the printer makes it nearly impossible to duplex print . It provides no support or assistance for manual duplexing and because the tray is awkward and hard to get to , it is more trouble than it is worth . I tried to write Brother to get help with some of the problems I have had with the printer only to discover that the customer service is atrocious : rude , impersonal , and unhelpful . The printer isn't all bad : The networking is easy to set up and generally works well . There 's a lot of features for what you pay ; it 's just too bad those features are so poorly executed . Don't make the same mistake I did . I was seduced by thinking I was getting a great value because of the wide feature set and low price . Unfortunately , the negatives far outweigh the positives , and this product is definitely not a " great value . " I miss my super-cheap 5-year-old Canon printer . It was light years ahead of this machine .
  i just got mine last week so i 'll just try to list some pros and consPros - the screen is more crisp and clear , just wonderful compared to the iPod video ( this is proof now that the images in the early reviews that the pics for Creative ARE NOT saturated to make them look better ) - sound quality is also better , this coming from Creative so for sure - the earbuds were the most surprising thing , they sound fantastic . I never realised how bad the ipod earbuds were until today ( i am a former 3rd G ipod owner ) when i walked into an Apple store and did a comparison in the store , then switched it with the Creative ones . The ipod ones don't isolate the sound as well and it lacks bass , as if it isn't there unless you use the EQ , whereas the Creative ones have a nice bass and a fresh clear sound . Even on the same volume the creative ones are considerably louder - 4 hours of video so you can actually watch a whole movie and still have some battery left over to listen to music - 15 hours of audio life , Creative website says 14hrs but on reviews by Cnet on test , it was actually 15 hours . - though bulkier than the ipod video , the size makes it easier to hold , IMO the size is perfect , it 's exactly the same as my 3rd Generation iPod with a silicon case - FM radio , great addition if you wanna just listen to the radio sometimes , i doCons - Internal battery so you can't personally remove it - the verticle scroll is a little too sensitive , being a former ipod user , it takes a bit of getting use to - buttons are a bit stiff at first , but i notice as time goes by it 's easier to press - no " on the go playlist " like the ipod , if there is i haven't found out how to do it yeti give this product a 9/10 , however because of some very biased reviews giving 0 or 1 , i am bumping this up for a 5/5
  THIS toy gets me so mad you charge is for 15 houres and 2 min 's after you take it off the charger the battery died . I threw mine out the windows . I hate cybikos never buy one . I dont care if its free do not get one
  I purchased this Coby product based strictly on the price point and was once again reminded of the old adage , " You get what you pay for . " The screen resolution was terrible . After reading product reviews and looking at demo models at various brick & mortar stores , I purchased a Philips 7 " frame . The pictures are sharp and I love the 4:3 aspect . I use Picasa to reduce my files to 800x600 size and they appear fanatstic on the frame .
  Memorex discs are always a good deal . I use them for DVD and CD authoring and have never ( yes , never ) encountered a problem with them . And you can usually find them on sale !
  I got this unit over 6 weeks now . Overall , I like the features ( divx , dual screen in / out , price ) but I 'm disappointed with the picture quality , it 's not as clear and sharp as I wanted , that 's why the 4 stars . I have not test the SD / MMC / USB feature for input of pics . Several reasons for buying this unit : 1 . Play DivxI test it and it does play quite some divx , even QPEL which Philips doesn't , but some QPEL doesn't render well . Also no MKV or OGM , that 's expected . Overall , I 'm satisfied with this feature . I watch anime divx and I can still read the subtitle overall , so I 'm ok with it . Again , don't expect sharp quality when it 's divx . When it 's just MPEG2 DVD , it 's not bad quality . 2 . Dual ScreenIt came w / Dual screens , one screen is with a DVD player and only does output AV . One screen is just a screen , but only takes input AV . Both screen has its own AC adapter and headphone jack . I guess it 's good for car ride , in fact , it comes w / straps to bound to the back of the car seat . 3 . Input / Output AVI needed input AV from my PS2 , so I can play it on the screen when my wife uses the TV . I 'm not as interested in the output since I have a DVD player for TV already . 4 . PriceFor $ 200 , it 's not a bad price for the features , it would really be a steal if wasn't for the ok pic quality . But normal 7 " portable DVD player will run about $ 150 + , so for $ 200 dual screen and with divx play back , it 's pretty good . Overall , I 'm really just using it as a personal player , if there 's portable DVD player that plays Divx , sharp image , take AV input and about the same price , I 'll be selling this unit . I don't really need the dual screen , it 's nice for the car ride , but I don't do car ride that often . Hee hee .. now you know I 'm a Otaku .
  Ear Buds are a disaster . I just discovered this . I am over 50 and figured my hearing was going ( which to a certain degree it is of course ) . After increasing the ripping quality for my CDs and still having issues with hearing stuff I decided to look into ear phones as a possible problem . They sure were .. these are great for the gym . I also bought some Sanheisers ( SP ? ) for twice the price and they are great also but too heavy for the gym . And too goofy looking even for me on a tread mill . I recommend this product .
  I returned my Tivoli PAL for the following reasons : 1 ) I wasn't blown away by the sound . I recently bought a Boston Acoustics Receptor Radio and was much more impressed with the boomy presence of that small radio . The PAL sounded much thinner . I 've read criticims of " too much bass " from the BA radio , so obviously it 's a matter of opinion . 2 ) Lack of features . No HD radio . Mono ( not a huge issue for me , actually ) . No alarm , digital readout , memory presets ( obviously ) . No switch to aux so I 'd have to plug / unplug the line everytime I wasn't to make the switch to / from my iPod . 3 ) I didn't plan to take advantage of its portability . I planned to leave this in my office , so one of the main advantages of this radio would be wasted . Returning this radio was not an easy decision because it is very cute and gets very good reception . I knew it lacked many features when I bought it . The main reason I returned it was because it lacked the rich , deep , room-filling sound I had hoped for . In the end , I just didn't think it was worth the $ 149 I paid for it . Now it 's $ 199 ? I think they used to be $ 99 . Isn't technology supposed to get cheaper over time ? There are a lot of 5 star reviews , so I 'm in the minority here . I 'd suggest listening to it before purchase if possible .
  The receiver handles all kinds of music with clarity and power . I live about 50 miles from most FM stations I listen to , and the receiver is sensitive enough to bring most of them in with just the wire antenna . The remote did not work when delivered . I contacted Harman Kardon and the customer rep sent another one to me . It works , but the keys are small and the colors of the keys , labels , and basic unit make using it harder than I would like .
  I bought this because my laptop is pretty old and doesn't have a fancy built in webcam . Image quality is alright , though it could be better . It 's good as a quick cheap fix for your webcam needs . I run Windows Vista and usually use Skype , and this works well for me . I even used it for an interview I had over Webex , and heard no complaints ( I landed the job as well ) .
  This was an awesome TV while it lasted . Unfortunately , the awesomeness was less was 2 years . Now the Panel Control Board is out which will be $ 500 to fix . Obviously , it makes more sense to buy a new set . Our old school Mitsubishi has held up 100 percent better . 12 years in service and only two repairs totaling less than $ 800 . 2 years , pathetic Panasonic !
  This printer is very good . I had it for about 3 years and I use it to print almost everything , from letters , envelopes etc . The biggest flaw I would say would have to be the occasional replacement of products . There are about 3 additional parts that require replacing ( this is not including the 4 ink cartridges ) While this is normal for most laser printers , the cost of these parts go well over the inital cost of the printer . The fuser alone sells for $ 350 , the transfer roller around $ 60 , the imaging unit $ 330 , and the 4 cartridges around $ 100 each . When you add everything up , it comes up to be almost 3 x TIMES MORE than the printer it self ( which is around $ 450 ) so basically , every year , you would be buying 3 printers .
  Garmin Vehicle Power Cable for n & uuml ; vi Portable GPS Navigators ( 010-10723-06 ) I returned this item since the GPS unit came with one . This should have been noted in the description of the GPS itself .
  I 've bought two of these for backups for two different Canon cameras . They 're much more affordable than the original Canon battery and perform as well or perhaps better . Excellent buy !
  I bought these a few months ago . They seemed to be a great improvement over the predecessors the Shure E2C 's and a set of Sony Earbuds . The sound is great , these have great clarity and range . The problem is they start to irritate your ears if worn for more than about an hour . I tried every different size adapter and still , ouch ! The second thing is that now they have fallen apart . The wires started to seperate at the jack and eventually broke leaving only the strain relief to hold the the jack on . The last thing is characteristic of all earbuds . This is the separation of the rubber ear interface from the earbud . I would take them out of the little gold bag and the little rubber earpiece would going flying off and leave me to hunt the floor of the airplane cabin to retrieve it .
  The cables were exactly as described . Worked like a charm ! My son is a much happier kid now to have his PC working again .
  I got these figuring they would make my ethernet cables I made look more professional and protect the connectors . They actually don't stay on the connectors and float down the wire from the connector . If you manage to get one to stay on the connector it will squeeze it 's tab and make it fall out of the device it 's plugged into . Absolutely worthless .
  Im not an electronics whiz at the least . Friend suggested this for a low cost dependable power supply to go with new video card , I installed both myself ! which is amazing .. Very simple does its job pushing new video card , 0 problems so far since purchase in june / 09
  At first I was all , " Woo Hoo " but after 3 days my Ipod froze and never came back so I exchanged it at Best Buy for another one . 2 hours later , it turned off and never turned back on so I exchanged it for ANOTHER one and then this one had battery failure . Yes , it may be cute , but if you 're gonna put up that kind of money , get the 20 gig . After I got my full refund and a month later on my birthday I bought the 20 gig and I LOVE it ! I can fit 20 times more songs and it 's reliable ! And a month later @ Best Buy I oddly saw 4 ipods on markdown out of box . ( I swear to God those are all mine )
  This is the first pair of decent headphones I bought , and the first pair that cost more than $ 20 . Let me first say that upgrading from earbuds to these is an eye-opening experience . However , two pairs have broken over the past year . Unfortunately , they offer no warranty of any kind . The first pair started crackling a lot , and eventually it would only work if you held the cable a certain way near the end . Since I liked the quality , I decided to buy another pair in case the first one was just defective . On this pair , the left ear just stopped working suddenly . I take very good care of my things ( especially expensive things ) , and have no idea why two pairs broke . I now have to wait a few days for some Sennheiser HD202s to be shipped to me , since I believe they will be of better sound quality anyway . There are a few other problems as well : The cord is extremely short , which makes it difficult to use when doing anything other than sitting at home listening to music . These headphones have another interesting problem . They don't play very loud , so even with my volume all the way up , I still had to strain to hear certain things . However , these also leak . A lot . So when I 'm riding the L or in an elevator , or anywhere where I 'm not alone , I have to turn down the music . And then I can't hear it very well ( at least not well enough to appreciate the sound quality ) . I also plug this into my amp sometimes , and I have to turn the volume on my guitar and the amp all the way up just to get loud enough to drown out the sound of the strings ( when I 'm playing with distortion ) . I really can't justify this purchase . I guess it introduced me to good sound quality and made me enjoy music much more since I could hear it , but the negatives far outweigh the positives , and I would not recommend these headphones to anyone , especially not for the price .
  Maybe I 'm a printer-holic : I have an Epson Photo R200 for photos . I have a Primera Signature Z6 for CDs ( fantastic printer , by the way ) . But I needed a fast , reliable printer for handouts and training materials . I work in Illustrator and InDesign , and PostScript Level 3 was critical . This printer is genuine Adobe PostScript ( not " PretendScript " like other printers ) , and it shows . But , beyond that , the entire experience is superior : the manufacturing standards are splendid ( great fit and finish ! ) , and the set-up guide is perfect-you can't go wrong . The little ink sticks are shape-coated so that even a trained squirrel could load them . The " walk-up installation " that finds Windows boxes and says " hello " automatically is wonderful . It 's speedy , sharp and chock full of great features I didn't know I 'd love . I highly recommend this printer !
  I bought this Zune for each one of my children ( basically I bought 2 ) because they were on super sale before christmas and I was able to get it for 79.99 which I thought was a great price . The screen was great , the music quality was good , and they loved the option to listen to the radio . However 2 months after christmas the Zunes quit charging no matter where I tried to plug them in I brought them to work I tried all 3 pc 's at my house , it was a nightmare . Then when I finally got my sons charged and tried to play it it completely froze . Never did get my daughters charged . So I called microsoft and spoke to a representative in there help center . After a 45 minute call where he had me do everything I had done at least 10 times before . He agreed to send me the packages to send them back to be fixed or replaced . I sent the Zunes back in the pre-paid fed-ex packages they sent about a month ago and have heard nothing since . So I will be calling them soon . But for others I would definetely suggest another route as this product just didn't last even for the price I paid it wasn't worth it .
  The ziga digital pic frame was easy to set up and works great . The only problem that I had was with the remote . The enter button on the remote does not work and did not work when I received it . Overall a good product .
  I bought this mp3 player because there was no way that I was going to fork over $ 200 + on an iPod with 1/10th the space . Also , I have a lot of music files in . ogg format , and I was ecstatic that this player supported them ! It 's also very easy to use - I didn't even need the manual to figure out how to set it up ! How it works : Plug & Play - it comes with driver software , but Win XP and newer versions of Mac ( OS X + ) will automatically install it and recognize it as a USB drive . From there it 's just drag & drop files from your computer to your player ! It supports . mp3 , . wma , . ogg , and . wav files , but not . mp4 ( iTunes ) , so you 'll need a file converter if you so wish . It has 20GB of space for songs and other files - I use it in place of a USB drive for some of my classes at school . It works perfectly ! Appearance : It 's super sleek , perfect size for a cell phone pocket if I want to take it on the go , easy menu navigation , and excellent play quality . Unlike the picture , it is EBONY BLACK with red undertone lights ( menu , arrows , play / pause ) . The screen is about 2 x 1.5 inches & full color - very awesome ! The whole player is about 4 x 3 inches , and 3/4 inch thick . Functionality : This player works super well . Excellent audio & very clear / thorough menu . I 've had it freeze on me a couple times , but it 's nothing that will damage it , and it 's fixed by turning it off and back on . I can't complain - but I don't use it as often as some people would . It 's probably too bulky to go running with , but it 's perfect for plugging into my computer speakers and just chilling out . It fits perfectly in the cellphone pocket of my purse for those long walks to class . It has a locking function to keep songs / volume from changing if you accidentally hit the touch-sensitive pad . All in all , I really love it ! Battery life : The battery life is a drawback - it gets a max of about 3-3.5 hours . But the A / C adapter charges it very quickly , so it 's good to go in less than 20 minutes . Video / Photos : The full color screen is like a tiny computer screen ! I haven't experimented with video yet , but photos of any size are fine . Video specs have to be within a certain screen resolution ( I think ) , and it doesn't support iTunes videos - just . avi videos . FM Radio : Almost CD quality sound . My favorite stations are local , so the playback quality is very good . I was surprised - usually FM tuners are quite poor in quality ! Other : The only thing I 'm having a problem with is figuring out how to make a playlist . There 's a default " favorites " playlist that holds up to 100 songs , but I don't know how to create another playlist . It 's probably in the manual and I just haven't read it , though . I 'm sure I 'm forgetting to mention something about this product , but I love my purchase , and I highly recommend this player to everyone who asks me about it !
  Even though the Spec 's posted by Amazon states it works with Windown 98 be aware that Linksys Ver . 4 will only work with Windows 98SE and above ( Per Linksys Tech Support ) . Linksys Ver . 2.6 and earler work with Windows 98 1st edition ( 4.10 ) and above . Amazon is only shipping WUSB11 's with Version 4.0This device also will not work with Tivo series 2 .
  Your wasting your money if you plan on getting a new computer anytime soon . Customer service is very poor . They try to sell you on a " discounted upgrade " for $ 100 since this is useless with windows 7 but the " discounted upgrade is an old machine that does not scan color and is cheaper to get on Amazon .
  I purchased the 50PF7320A / 37 50 " plasma tv from philips online store in Aug 2006 . Eight days after i received it the tv wouldn't power on and there was a flashing red LED on the front panel . I called philips to request a warranty repair . I was able to arrange repair with a local TV repair shop that services Philips warranty repairs . They came an picked it up . The problem was with one of the circuit boards in it . They were able to quickly indentify the problem and order a replacement part . The first part order took 2 weeks to even be delivered and then when the tv repair shop received it , it was DOA . The tv shop requested a replacement and then the part was on and is still to this day on back order with no ETA . The repair shop said it could possibly be months before the part was shipped in . So then i am furious i called philips to try to complain but they wouldn't even open a consumer complaint until the part was on back order for at least 1 month . So now i am having to wait over a month even after just having the tv for a week before i can even try to get my money back or a replacement tv . Then just as the 6 weeks had passed since it broke , the tv repair shop was able to use a part out of an existing working set just to get it back to me . Since i had been waiting so long . Now 3 days after receiving it back , the TV is acting up again , the same things it was doing , relays clicking on / off while set is off , before it stopped working altogether , are happening again . Found out that the part is still on back order . Appearently there is defective part that has not been fixed in these unit . Buyer beware , as if you purchase this set , it might work for a short time , and you will have it in the shop for more time then you can probably stand . Philips customer service is a joke , technical service is joke . This unit comes with a 1year warranty , and the additonal 2yr ext warranty costs over $ 700 . if you want to puchase this with a ext . just expect to pay the additional cost with the TV . In thinking back , if i would have know this was going to be such an ordeal . I would purchased a much better set from a better company and possilby even with a retail store such as best buy or someone who you can work directly with rather than going through philips directly . Just wanted to share my experience with this unit . One good note though . while its actually working , i am satisfied with the quality for the original sale price ( not including ext warranty ) . But if its going to break , then whats the point .
  This FM device wooks very poorly in metro areas . I mean poorly . Maybe out in the country towns with only a couple of transmitting stations it would work as advertised . don ; t waste $ otherwise
  great camera , has a connection for an exterior flash .. in my business I use this little gadget in lieu of a polaroid back .. save a lot of time and money .. helps me check lighting in matter of seconds .. matches the prowess of the nikon coolpix , for half the price .. to the reviewer that alleges his photos come out darker than the lcd image .. add an extra flash ( activated by another flash with a slave attachment ) after all photography is light and if you do not have enough light your photos are going to come out dark .. the more light the better your photos .. when using the digital zoom , a tripod is necessary for sharp photos .. image stabilizer will render this camera with a prohibitive prize , after all what do you expect for 400 dollars ..
  I never thought of buying a power surge for more than $ 50 but I ended up bought two PureAV PF60 's . I know my power surge strip is suck and cheapy so I was looking for a better one to protect my gear and ran across the pureAV . After searching and comparing models between PureAV and Monster , I decided to go for the PureAV ( PF40 vs PF60 vs Monster 3500/3600 ) . I spent hours to go back and forth with / without the power console just to hope i can hear the different and I did . After that I just went to my computer and order the second one . Pros : - Price , around $ 250 new - 13 programmable , including the auxillary outlet . - Stage-6 filtering ( vs stage-3 from monster ) - big and heavy power cable . - Look nice and very cool on the rack . - Many other features , probably same as in HTS3500 . - High quality components , small gauge wires inside . - LIFETIME warranty . Cons : - QA / QC problem : both units have faulty outlet at bank 5 . The first one has to go back because the programmable switch is broken . The second I fixed it because of the loose terminal . - Can not set the " hight current " outlet to switch mode . I set the console to turn on / off the Amp trigger by the pre-amp but my speakers hum when it switch offr . I think it 's leaking current . - Black version is hard to find unless you want to pay more . As I said earlier , I bought the second one because I just hear the different soundstage of my stereo . I just wanted to test to make sure it works properly before put on my main AV rack but I just hear the different and my wife also confirmed that . It 's not just day and night but the music and the singer voice sound really pleasure , smooth and clear . Please don't quote me for this . I just want to share my story but it 's not my point because not many will believe it . I strongly recommend to spend a little more to get a decent surge protector , doesn't have to be a power console , just to protect your gear and rest assure that your systems , new LCD / plasma are well protected .
  I received this as my 40th birthday present from my wife and loved it right away . It was great until six months later when the screen went haywire . Lost the picture but had vertical lines up and down , stuck on . Palm sent me a refurbished unit that died within 2 months . Screen failed to come on . Palm sent me another refurbished unit ( that was pretty beat up ) but I cannot use the keyboard to enter text into a DateBook line item . The cursor jumps to top everytime . Others have had this problem as I 've read on a Palm Tungsten Forum . Palm is sending me another refurbished unit . This will be my 4th and I 'll sell this one and get another brand . Pretty disappointed with Palm .
  Well , It worked " OK " for about a year . All of the sudden it stopped working after the warranty was completed . Did not work well with virus software installed and never create CD-ROMs at the max speed . Overheated and crash the computer several times before it completely died . Buy something else !
  I have q-see 8 camera DVR and 1 of my camera 's was too far for the 60 feet cable included . I ordered this from amazon even with the so so reviews . The cable came , I checked it with my easy to get camera . The BNC extension worked just fine , but the power did not work . Sent back to amazon that day ( 1 hour after receiving ) , amazon sent me a new one the next day . Tested it on the short camera everything worked just fine . Ran the 100ft extension + 60 ft of original camera . All worked fine during the day . Problem comes at night . The camera requires more power at night for night vision . Sure enough this camera does not work at night . All the other cameras work just fine at night . Too the A / C adapter and plugged directly in camera ( everything in easy to get to attic ) and works fine . Plugged power directly into the 100ft cable ( minus the 60ft to the dvr ) and it did not work . Even with the a / c adapter in my attic , just for this camera , the 100ft is too long and does not carry enough power for the cameras at night . The 60ft cables work just fine , but if you need to get power down this 100ft cable for night vision forget it . Night vision is not really that important since it is only good for a short distance and the cable works during the day so I am using it because other cables are more expensive and who knows if the A / C adapter with the q-see system will go 160ft ? For me I needed to buy another A / C adapter , just for this camera . Plug in with extension cord to the camera in the attic . Then all works fine since BNC cable runs to the DVR . So 1 worked barely , the other didn't at all and I tested right out of the box .
  I was shopping for a lightweight , inexpensive pair of " behind the head " headphones . That 's just what I received . As advertised , absolutely satisfied .. The one issue , which seems common to all behind the head headphones is that the band gets in the way at times . It would be great if this was adjustable so that it could be made to fit the individual . Unfortunately , that would likely increase the weight , which was an important factor in why I chose this particular model .
  I ordered 3 cables and one was defective . It wasn't obvious and took me a little while to figure out as the problem was intermittent . I didn't bother to send it back or get a replacement since it was so cheap in the first place .
  Save your money , Dont buy this TV . Below is an email i sent to Phillips customer sevice and still waiting for response . To whom it may concern , I have purchased a Phillips 50 in plasma TV ( 50PFP5332D / 37B ) in August 2007 . Eleven months ( July 2008 ) later TV broke and it was replaced by refurbished unit after 40 days of wait ( The TV was still under warranty ) . Today ( February 2010 ) TV broke again for what it seems exact problem . The " relay " was clicking and then TV just died . That is what exactly happened in July 2008 . I am very disappointment customer with Phillips product . This is unheard that same TV ( same model ) dies twice in 3.5 years . My last TV ( Sony ) was replaced after 17 years and it still works ! Obviously there is questionable quality of the Phillips TV . I will never purchase another Phillips product . Disappointed customer ,
  So , I 've had my creative zen : vision for several years now - since they first came out , and I have never stopped loving it . I had started out with an ipod as it was the thing to have at the time ( and still is , sadly ) and I was not at all impressed . My ipod died every three months like clockwork , so I gave up on it and went out and bought this . Best choice I ever made . This thing has been dropped in water , hurled across a room ( quite by accident ) , and dropped on every surface imaginable more times than I can count . ( I do try to take care of my expensive electronics , but mp3 players have a way of finding their way out of my pocket when I 'm running / exorcising ) Because of this abuse , the face has come off and has to be kept on by duct tape .. but the thing still works beautifully ! And when it does freeze ( which isn't often ) it has a handy little reset button that fixes everything . ( my ipod was forever freezing and it 's hold the buttons down reset method usually didn't work ) It has scratches , dings , scrapes but I love the thing and I 'll be very sad when I do have to replace it . I would recommend this mp3 player to anyone , it 's quite the gem .
  I was happy to see the ithe as soon as I did ; Quality merchandise at a great buy , fast shipping , excellant buy .
  Surprised at the great quality , and with the Amazon supper saver free shipping , this has to be a best buy , they are long enough to have to pay extra shipping via UPS .
  It 's what I expected out of a FM transmitter . What sets this apart is the USB charger feature , making it easy to charge my phone and play music at the same time . the signal has trouble in big cities though , even on unused frequencies . Also listen to the instructions when it says put player volume to 2/3 , otherwise you will get significant distortion .
  No way to trouble shoot - no way to see inside the device . After the 100 + dollars spent , you 'd think you wouldn't just have to throw it away . What a waste .
  I purchased this a few months ago and wanted to wait till I used it several times before I wrote a review . Well , I love it ! I bought this because I saw Emeril Lagasse make several recipes in a pressure cooker on his show . Wow ! This cooker is amazing . I 've cooked several dishes in it , and every one of them has turned out delicious . I usually cook pot roast in a slow cooker for 6-8 hours depending on weight , but with this cooker you can do the same roast in only 45 minutes ! It comes out the same ; tender and juicy as if it was slow cooked for hours . I made chicken cacciatore in it last night , amazing ! It only took 10 minutes to cook ( about 2 to get desired pressure and then 8 min . with the knob rocking consistently ) . Wow again , it cooks food so much faster in less than half the time with the same results as if you were to cook for hours . My next dish is Emeril 's spicy ginger baby back ribs . He has lots of recipes for pressure cookers . Besides , this presser cooker comes with a recipe book and the recipes are fabulous . Also , since the cooker is stainless steel , nothing sticks and clean up is a breeze . It hasn't tarnished , nicked , changed color or fouled up on me whatsoever . It still looks brand new , even through all the uses . I definitely recommend this product !
  I set this up and was initially very impressed - easy to use , good sound quality for the size and price of the unit . Within a couple of hours , however , something shorted out - the display started blinking with no LCD characters . Unplugged , plugged it in several times , changed batteries , etc . but no effect . I was going to exchange it for another , but these reviews have changed my mind and I am getting a full refund instead . The lack of radio presets is a surprising inconvenience but the way the wake-up volume works ( automatically going to MAX ) is an absolute show-stopper . This product has potential , but not without some design changes and better quality control .
  I purchased the Sony speakers to use in a home office . They offer excellent sound at a reasonable price . Good quality for the money .
  For now this may seem unimportant but something down the road happens and I need this plan and I have it . Hallejuea !
  It took me a while to understand this card was the source of my computer freezing every few seconds , but noticing that Metatrader 4 sounded a disconnect alarm during the freeze-up made it obvious . Repairing my wireless connection would get rid of it for a variable amount of time , but it always returned . I tried everything Trendnet suggested , I even reinstalled Windows XP , ( which gave me a nice clean fast new installation free of all the junk I had accumulated ! ) but nothing helped . I 'm buying a new card , probably the Super G 802.11BG Wireless Pci 64 Bit Xp Compliant Turbo Mode by MSI , since it has the best reviews .
  These speakers are awesome for their size . Great sound for DVD surround sound and cd 's . Very adequate subwoofer for a small room . Also purchased the matching surround back speaker and it too works well . Good buy for the price if you are looking for small speakers .
  Bought the printer from Staples for $ 149 in 2005 . Bought it because of Lexmark 's reputation and my previous laser was a Lexmark . It is fast - greasy fast - however it sounds like a tank . Initial powerup takes about 30 seconds . Average time to print for text is about 7-10 seconds . Graphics take much , much longer . It seems like Lexmark , to make the printer cheaper , made it dumber . Printing a document with complex graphics ( a picture , PDFs , etc . ) takes forever - it seems . A positive is the 250sheet paper tray . However , when the printer runs out , it keeps spinning a paper grab wheel until paper is loaded . The printer looks nice with a black shell and grey top . . The output bin is poorly designed and printing big documents will result in pages that have to be shuffled and aligned . Oh , the initial toner cartridge is only good for about 2000 pages . Overall , I was disappointed and will probably replace the printer within a year - and not with another Lexmark .
  This antenna doesn't provide an adequate signal ; it is less than half as effective compared to the pair of rabbit ears that I had lying around the house .
  The one I bought is all packaged ready to go back to the store . It was cheaper than the Linksys , and I had used D-link NIC 's before so I figured I would try it . Boy am I sorry . After 3-4 hours working on this thing I think I 'm in 1986 again . Problem 1 : None of the installation procedures followed the sequence of the printed instructions . I went through a constant questioning process of " where am I now ? " and " what is it trying to say ? " as I tried to translate their instructions said to what I was seeing . This problem was worse as I had to go through the process in part several times . Problem 2 : There seems to be a problem with any install on a Windows XP system . Great . That 's like having gasoline that works in anything but a Chevrolet . This is ultimately what my show-stopper was . Although I found the instructions on the web site and running back and forth between computers , worked my way through them , but , they don't work after you 've done everything else in the instructions - you would have to do them DURING the install , meaning you would have to know that there was an XP problem in the first place . For the folks at D-Link : inability to operate with XP is useful information for a BUYING decision , not an installation . Problem 3 : Tech support . Literature gives a 24x7 number which it is not . I made four calls total and had line suddenly go dead in two of them . Bottom line : I did have the card operating and on the network , but could not ping . I have no doubt tech support could have gotten me going within a few minutes if they were not busy doing the same for every other buyer . I would only buy this card if I were buying in quantity and had the time to figure out how to make the first one work , then could leverage that information .
  These Selectors are a fantastic way to organize your DVD 's . We have over 300 DVD 's which would be next to impossible to store in their original holders .
  Yes , unlike other reviewers , I do own a 40gig iPod Photo ( as of 10/04 ) .. and yes I do also own a regular 3G 15gig iPod ( plus I 'm not pushing IP Address harvesting scams like the " free iPod " reviews ) .. so this was quite an expensive UPGRADE decision for me .. so this review is geared towards those struggling with an upgrade decision ( for those who own a smaller / lighter 10-20gig music iPod ) .. I own both PC and Mac formats . 1 ) BOTTOM LINE : Although \ very , very \ cool , I do not believe the trade-offs between the large size / weight and photo capability & extra battery life .. are worth the enormous price ( which includes a software purchase ) . Yes my 4 star rating is entirely based on how much incremental " stuff " you get versus what you have to fork over . But if money is not an object and you already own the larger / heavier 40gig variety , this becomes a " NO-BRAINER " upgrade - the ` wow ' factor is huge . If you travel quite a bit for business like I do , this is also a good addition to keep you company during trips . 2 ) PHOTO QUALITY : Good to " pretty good " .. but not excellent .. I do realize the size of the screen is only 2 inches , but photos tend to be slightly pixilated , even the full resolution ones that are over 2mb ( though you stop noticing after a minute ) and color reproduction is not all that great on skin tones and deep reds , but very good w / greens & blues .. ; which make pics of landscapes quite nice ! 3 ) PHOTOS ON MY TV : Now this is where this thing shines .. this is a really cool feature .. the iPod includes a mini plug to RCA out ( headphone to 3 pronged yellow / white / red ) that produces cool results when you plug it into your TV .. you can scroll through your photos on your big ( or at least bigger than your computer screen ) TV screen . However , having only 2800 + photos on my iPod ( that 's more than avg ) , I got tired of flipping through & showing off my albums in about 2 days .. 4 ) MUSIC : Besides not being able to see the screen as well w / out the backlight , it 's the same as any click-wheel , 4G iPod . 5 ) SIZE / WEIGHT : If you already own a 40gig variety , you won't have much to complain about .. but if you have a 10-20gig iPod , you will add more size and weight to your pocket ( or bag ) . Moving from a 3G 15gig , this difference \ to me \ is significant , as my iPod usually resides in my jacket pocket . 6 ) COSMETIC CHANGES : None on the outside , still scratches as easily as the rest , but has a color screen w / a new font and screen looks very dark w / out the backlight . 7 ) BATTERY LIFE : Conditional based on the user .. i never trust battery reviews on websites , as they vary DRASTICALLY when I employ my personal uses to the device . However , so far it seems to run near spec during mixed use .. and much longer than my 3G iPod . = SURPRISES OUT OF THE BOX = A ) NEED TO BUY SOFTWARE : In order to enable the cooler features - like syncing albums automatically , etc .. , you need to purchase or own iLife ( iPhoto specifically ) 4.03 or better ( if you are the rare few that bought your computer in the last few months w / 4.0 , you still have to download an upgrade to 4.03 ) .. Now I bought my iMac from the Apple website last Christmas and it still shipped w / iLife 2.0 .. so I had to purchase iLife 4.0 ( according to several company reps , there is no free upgrade from the jump from 2.0 to 4.0 ) .. which took me an additional day to figure out .. Yes , you can assign folders and such to sync to your photos to your iPod , BUT having an album editor enables full control of changes and what changes I 'm making , to the entire process . Oh Yeah , you need a high version of iTunes as well ; my pod came w / ver . 4.7 .. IMHO , you \need\ the iPhoto upgrade to enjoy this purchase . B ) TRANSITIONS : Only the " wipe " from right-to-left is included , maybe more will be avail in the future , but you are not given a choice . C ) SLIDESHOWS : You cannot assign multiple music lists in iTunes to specific albums in iPhoto .. as of 10/04 , you can only assign a SINGLE music list to ALL photo albums when you enable the slideshow feature . Yes , you can change this music list , but need to go back to the menu to do so . Also , you can only display-to-TV in slideshow mode ; you can't just flip through your albums in browse mode through your TV.D ) COLOR SCREEN : When not backlit , the screen during regular music playback turns \VERY\ dark , much more so than regular B & W ; iPods .. you need a light source reflecting off of the screen in order to see the letters .. typeface has changed too , more like " Arial " and slightly smaller . Oh yeah , with the backlight off , the screen still displays in color . TECHNICAL DETAILS : A ) You cannot adjust the color quality , size , cropping or transitions of the photos when detached from your computer , so don't bother asking a apple representative on the phone or at the store - they don't make enough money to actually buy one themselves . I 've tried two different stores the NY area . B ) Both the 40/60gig packages come w / an iPod dock ( if you don't have one already ) , but like the old ones , do not allow for use w / thick iPod skins and covers . C ) Comes with an iPod dock WITH a S-Video output ( new ) and a solo USB 2.0 cord ( finally ! ) . D ) Yes , this is thicker and heavier than your 10-15gig , traditional music iPod . E ) If you never upgrade your iTunes due to the hacks you can employ on earlier versions , then you cannot use the photo feature ( yes I tried ) . [ .. ]
  I just got it today . Well I must say I ` m very impressed by huge ammount of features , like Ipod dock , HDMI Port with 1080i upconversion , playable Divx movies and USB port . This is excelent entry level home theater for a great price comparing to other system avalible on the market today . A very intersting point is that this home theater has an option of firmware upgrade so it 's possible to update the software for this home theater when it does become avalible online , which is obviously great and gives an option of improvements and even adding some new features . Don't hesitate to buy If you 're looking for an excellent entry level home theater system .
  My husband bought this for me last year primarily for the radio as I like to listen to local channels while I 'm having breakfast before I leave for work . The radio reception is great but the CD player stopped recognizing CD 's after only a few plays . What 's the sense of having an appliance that only partially works ? We just finished remodeling our kitchen and I told my husband not to reinstall this piece of junk on our new cabinets . What 's wrong with GE ? Can't they do anything right ? We 've had so much bad luck with GE appliances in the past ten years that now I 'm even apprehensive about getting on an airplane powered by GE engines !
  Yes this printer is pretty cheap and prints well , and the ink cartridges are cheap . That said , I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone because the ink runs out really really fast . The cartridges it takes only hold 10ml of ink ( most hold at least 17ml and some out there hold up to 50ml ) and won't print more than 250 pages of text .
  THESE TAPES WERE VERY CHEAP BUT ONCE YOU ADDED THE SHIPPING IT WAS ABOUT THE SAMES PRICE AS THE REST - TAPES WERE ABOUT $ 4-$5 AND SHIPPING WAS @ $ 15 . OH WELL THE TAPE IS GOOD QUALITY AND I NEEDED THEM .
  DANGER : 2-prong plug can lead to electrocutionUpdate 12/16/05 : Syntax 's response to my Better Business Bureau ( BB ) complaint said , " We talked to the customer and the customer accepted the resolution . " In fact , they did not talk with me . I note that their BB score is now a ` D ' . Original review ( 12/12/05 ) : Too good to be true ? I plugged it into a 2-slot electrical outlet . ( Such ungrounded electrical outlets are common in older homes . ) Careful ! My unit had 120 volts on the coaxial ( cable ) input . Accidentally , I touched the cable to my stereo case , and it had a HUGE spark . It must have enough current to give a dangerous shock . After one-half a day of calling ( 12/12/05 ) , I finally was able to talk with Miguel . He said I had a grounding problem . Eventually , their engineer , Joe , returned my call . Joe said that 120 volts on the chassis was not a defect . Although , he would not accept the unit as a return , he thought it was a good idea to return it to Amazon . Joe indicated that the unit must be grounded , and it would not be uncommon for an ungrounded unit to have 120 volts on the chassis . Appliances should never produce 120 volts on the chassis , even if the ( center ) ground post is removed . ( Read for yourself ; search for " how stuff works 2 and 3 prong plugs " . ) Apparently , the unit has a " hot " wire touching the chassis . It seems the Joe ( or Syntax ) does not want to admit to a defect in the product . I recommend that you do NOT purchase the product unless you have a grounded 3-prong electrical outlet . Additionally , I recommend you consider their customer service . Call Syntax . See how long it takes to talk to a human . I called for one-half a day . They have an odd answer system . Even if you choose to " talk to the operator " , you will have to leave a message . Eventually , I did speak to Miguel . Then , Joe called me . However , it took all day . ( I first called at 8:00 PST ; finally , Joe called me at 3:15 PST . ) It 's too bad . The unit seems to have good color . The sounds is a bit odd , but can be configured . It does not have good reception . On many channels received by my old TV , this unit goes to blue screen and indicates " no signal " . If it were not for the defective ( and dangerous design ) and for the poor customer service , I would recommend the TV as a good value . However , I 'm not risking my house , or my other electronics to this poorly designed unit . Check the voltage on your unit 's coaxial ( cable ) input before connecting to you cable , least you damage other TVs or receivers on your cable .
  bought 2 set 's they work great ! had only 1 gig , changed to 4 gig computer flies now . Some of the best memory out there !
  I purchased this modem it was a hunk of junk the tech support was no help . I was not happy with the quality of this modem .
  I bought this particular DVD player at Best Buy , and while it does what it 's supposed to do , which is play DVDs , its build quality is mediocre at best . With a 4 year warranty in hand , I 've had to replace my unit 4 times now . Problems include - no audio from speakers , black and white picture instead of color on the screen , and recently , the lid just won't close . If you want a cheap DVD player , you probably cannot do better than this . I highly recommend getting an extended warranty though . It 'll definitely pay for itself in the long run .
  This is a great product and we have had NO issues with it .. does not distort or color pictures . A Great product .
  I 'm not sure what speed / spec these cables are .. so I don't know if they would work for 3D . They work great for 1080i and I like how thin the cables are ; I got two them to route through a desk-mount monitor stand and the thinness made it easy to slide them through my cable management system .
  This mini tripod is a pretty good basic design , but to work in practice I had to cut a couple of inches off the center post and swap out the head for a decent ball head . The plastic pan head is simply not strong enough to hold anything but a point and shoot . Certainly not a D800 . The head 's main problem is the plastic hinge that allows the camera to be rotated into vertical . It 's supposed to be an additional feature but makes the head so " floppy " that at best you can only shoot static shots : forget panning or tilting during a video take . It 's also very difficult to level the horizon . That hinge again . It simply can't be tightened enough to hold the camera level . The suction cup on the center post is supposed to attach to a flat surface , but the surface has to be perfect to work . Not likely . The cup deteriorated after a couple of years , too , becoming superfluous . Worse , with the legs retracted to their shortest ( and most stable ) position the center post has to be extended upwards . Now the camera is really top heavy and , again , the whole thing is unstable . I speak from trying to shoot video clips in Washington DC , where you aren't allowed to use a full-sized tripod . So I carried this little guy , setting it on domed trash receptacles or benches . Those domes together with That excessively long center post made it almost impossible to use . It wasn't up to the job . I came home and shortened the center post , removed the pan head and replaced it with a sturdy ball head . Still can't really pan , but can at least level the horizon . I 'd recommend a different setup . After I got done cutting the center post and adding aGiottos MH1302-655 Professional Calibrated Ball Head with MH 655 Quick ReleaseI should have gotten theSUNPAK MINI-PROPLUS / B Mini Tripod with Compact Ballhead .
  Mount secures well to the bike and the new battery door attaches firmly to the garmin . Works just as it should .
  The package did not appear to have been damaged , but the end cap was cracked and it cannot be used . Unfortunately , the time to return has expired . I don't know if I can find parts . I don't want to have to buy another one .
  I bought this lens after returning the canon 75-300 that I was very unhappy with . This lens has impressed me every step of the way and yielded some excellent images . I highly recommend it . and if your on the fence like I was trying to decide if you need the IS or not . Just do it . you wont be sorry , My only regret was wasting my time with the non IS version . Click order and enjoy . You will thank me .
  The Camera Bag turned out to be absolutely perfect for my needs . My Olympus D-550 camera fits perfectly into the pouch . The pouch has a padded removable velcro divider . My Kodak Max K2000 battery charger fits great on the other side ( at an angle because its width is larger than the pouch . On the other side is my camera with product manual . They fit just right such that they fit snug and cannot move around . In the front zippered pouch my memory cards fit perfectly into their special slots and the batteries fit in their respective elastic straps also . There was even room above the batteries for another 4 batteries in an additional small mesh pouch . In the zippered front pouch I was able to put some cables in loosly and the thing still closed nicely . The top of the bag velcros shut and then there is a buckle to snap in . This thing is built tough with a nice canvas like waterproof material . On the outside there is another mesh pouch on the side that my USB cable fit right into . On the back is a velcro strap that could be used to attach to a belt . I love the bag and would recommend it for all your small digital camera needs !
  I was working on a wireless network that had the MR814 wireless router from Netgear and it was a real mess . The network had two computers on it . The first computer was plugged into the router along with a cable modem . The second computer accessed the network via a Netgear wireless USB hub . The first problem came when the router refused to allow the first PC to access the Internet . After much time I finally got the router to allow the connection and both computers were able to connect to the Internet . Then another problem came up where the second computer , and the first computer could not talk to each other so they could exchange files with one another . No matter what was done the two computers still had problems communicating except when it came to the Internet . I would not recommend this problem as it doesn't seem like a very good one . Two XP machines should not have this much difficulty connecting to each other . Also forget Netgear tech support as you can't understand a word they are saying because they have it based in India now . I had to repeat the router info 3 or 4 times to them even though I went as slow as a turtle reading the numbers . If you find something better than Netgear then grab it . I can't possibly think of a worse product out there .
  My daughter 's car has a relatively small glove box , but there were certain items she wanted to keep in there . This organizer was just what she wanted . Big enough to get her required documents into , plus a small flashlight , pen , pencil , notepad , map ; yet small enough to fit in the small opening referred to as a glove box . Works great for her needs . Case Logic AGB-11 Glove Box Organizer ( Nylon , Black )
  This is a super lens , very sharp and clear , excellent for macro work . The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it is not a simple lens to use . It requires a very solid tripod and focusing is done by changing magnification or moving the object or sometimes the camera . At high magnification such movements have to be made very carefully .
  The description of this product states that it will work with Windows 2000 . It does not . Even after contacting the vendor , who said it would work with Service Pack 4 installed on Windows 2000 . It does not , it won't even install itself . Very poor product , don't waste your money .
  I had read the reviews here on Amazon , and then went to the JVC web site . JVC claimed that only " a few " of these decks had the " LOADING " malfunction , and that repairs were " simple . " I decided that , since JVC is ( was ? ) a reputable company , they must have had some problems with the early run of these decks , and that I could trust them to have caught and repaired the malfunction on their later decks . The first deck I bought failed within 15 days , so I could exchange it . This entailed a lot of hassle with UPS deliveries , and I 've never been reimbursed for my cost of returning the defective deck . The second deck took a month to malfunction . So I had to send it to JVC repair services to correct the problem . More UPS , more hassles . The deck was returned after almost a month . The second DVD I played in it caused the malfunction again . By this time I was within a week of JVC 's measly 90-day warranty ( for labor-parts are usually a negligible part of the bill ) . So I gave up . Now I have a sometimes-functioning machine that I really resent . $ 600 for this ? ! ? You 'll want a bigger hard drive ( 80Gb = only 16 hours recording time at DVD speed ) and probably should wait until the second generation of these machines makes its appearance . Would I buy from JVC ? Hah .
  I installed this in one of my SUV 's that is not driven for weeks at a time . The Schumacher unit keeps a perfect charge and does not overheat or dry out the battery . The clock , radio , and GPS settings are all preserved and the charger does not seem to draw much power when the battery is charged . I am very satisfied with the operation of the unit . The installation was a breeze with the included hardware and the instructions were clear and easy . I do have two small complaints , however :( 1 ) The battery lugs were way too big for my vehicle and all other cars that I checked . ( 2 ) The AC plug is too short to run anywhere . I wanted the plug to reach to just outside the vehicle 's grill , so that the unit could be plugged in without opening the hood . I had to install an extra extension cord for that purpose .
  This is my first light meter , so I can't make comparisons to other models , but this L-358 is easy to use and understand provided you have an intermediate knowledge of camera exposure settings and lighting . This model can also support an optional module that will fire strobes / flashes connected to PocketWizards .
  Just bought this but it 's over 30 days now . New TV with Netflix dingle still drops signal . Bought a new Mac Mini and after two days trying to connect to the net , an Apple wireless professional said these " G " routers are 4 year old technology . He thinks that G does not support the new Mac Mini or other new electronics very well . Now I have to go purchase a new " N " router . I thought I did my research but I guess not enough . At least list that these old " G " routers are not the best for newer electronics .
  This cable is exactly what we needed and it works perfectly . We use it to hook up our video camera to the TV so we can see what we are taping .
  Replaced a couple of basic power strips with this . Looks better & I feel better about using this instead of the power strips . Hope I never have to find out if this protects better or not . Price was better than what I could find locally . Shipping was timely & product arrived before delivery date . Would order again from this seller .
  I 've owned this printer for 8 years ( bought it new , but not on Amazon ) and it is still going strong . My use is not that heavy , but I definitely use it at least weekly , and it has served me well for printing out wedding invitations , PDFs , black and white photos and maps , tax forms , coloring pages for my kids , envelopes , you name it . Amazingly , I am still on the original toner and drum that came with the unit . I have never experienced a problem or failure with this printer . Before I had this printer I had an Epson inkjet photo printer which worked good at first , but kept jamming , etc , and I realized with the ink costs , it was cheaper just to get my photos printed at a certain nationwide chain store . And , I hardly ever printed anything in color . One thing that I should mention is that the factory installed memory is a bit limited . It 's definitely fine for printing documents and most everyday printing , but in order to print full page full-resolution pictures and such , you 'll need to upgrade the memory ( I have mine maxed out ) , otherwise the printer will convert the picture to a lower resolution . I doubt that I use my extra memory often , but it 's nice knowing I am able to print a full 1200x600 page if I feel like it . I realize this printer is now considered obsolete , and so my review is probably wasted , but for what it 's worth , Brother has gained a very satisfied customer and if / when this thing finally dies , you can be certain I 'll be buying another one of their quality products .
  Things you find out once you can't make something work and then read the manual .. 1 . There is no native 720p . It downscans it to 480p . 2 . The PIP , auto-off on no-signal , and double-display and still-screen functions only operate on tuner input and Svideo . If you use the progressive inputs NONE of those functions will work . 3 . The TV powers on in tuner mode ( not in " last source used " mode ) . It takes 8.5 seconds ( timed by my Pronto ) from hitting the power button before you can switch it to any alternate input source ( Svid , RCA , Component .. ) 4 . The sound output ( monitor outs ) do NOT work when the component video inputs are selected . In other words , if you use Svid to feed the sources , you can use the TV to feed audio as one source to your audio system . If you use Component , you have to individually feed the audio directly into your audio system and separately switch them . Mine was ordered 3/22 , given to shipper 3/23 , delivered4/7 ( yes , it took over two weeks ) , and the shipper triedto do a curbside delivery untilI " explained " that they could either do the white glovedelivery that was called for and paid for , or they couldtake it back . It 's a good interim until plasma HDs come down in price , but if you 're looking for a long term HDtv , you may wantto wait for true 720p , 1080p , monitor-out on all sources , powerup with previous source selected , multiple savedconvergence settings ( standing , sitting , couch-right , couch-left , etc . ) E
  exceeds my needs , but the cost of replacing my equipment makes this purchase a minor issue . I 'll buy another . A great peace of mind investment .
  Received this unit and had it set up and operating in 20 minutes . Great picture with standard signal from Direct TV . Can't wait to see HDTV . This is the best name brand unit at 26 " that I could find for less than $ 900 . At $ 799 and free shipping it is the best deal around . As a prime customer , 1 day shipping cost a whopping $ 3 . Paid for itself in one transaction .
  All these great reviews perplex me .. maybe mine was just the luck of the draw . After just 9 months of occasional use , it just displays " service required " and never alerts me . I 'm a pretty techie person , so I searched websites and read the manual , and tried all the troubleshooting steps mentioned ( i.e. re-programming , mounting the radar detector in a different location , & then re-calibrating after each troubleshooting step , etc . ) . I even used another non-Beltronics radar detector when following my husband 's truck to see if there are literally no radar alerts , and his Whistler alerted us while my V955 remained silent . Beltronics will not repair it under warranty because I can't find the original receipt , EVEN THOUGH I REGISTERED THE WARRANTY WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND THEY HAVE ME LISTED IN THEIR DATABASE . I thought that was the whole point of registering the warranty ? They want $ 100 just to look at it . The warranty statement in the manual says nothing of this . So regardless of the great reviews other shave for this product , what if you are one of the " lucky " ones who get a lemon like me who ends up with a $ 279 paperweight ? Thumbs DOWN . Will never order a Beltronic product again !
  I have to only give this 2 stars . The product description says that this product is 2x1.2x48 when in fact it is 1x . 5x48 . This is a significant issue . If I didn't need to do this project in 2 days I would probably send it back for the right product . I think I can force the cables I need in here and have it stay shut , if it does workout then I may raise my star rating to 3 but the whole " false advertisement " in the dimensions has really set me back . Outside of that the product itself looks good
  nice comfy , wireless keyboard n mouse . easy to use . it was nice deal for the price !
  I bought these for my 18 month old so she could watch movies on plane rides , I was afraid they wernt gonna fit right but they fit perfectly and she loves wearing them ! im so happy I purchased this item !
  Needed an affordable replacement battery for my old iBook G4 workhorse and I got it . I 'd surely buy again and suggest others take a look at this fine product .
  I purchased this for my mother in law who could not hear the phone ring . The ringer does have a volume control as well as a slider on the side to adjust the tone but it is just not that loud . About as loud as a regular telephone ! I was looking for loud and just did not get it !
  I love these ear buds ! I keep buying the same pair over and over after they start to go bad . I wear them for at least 10 hours every day / night . They fit comfortably in the ear . The wires will eventually start to crack or break if you move them around a ton , but it takes a good 4-5 months for that to happen and alot of wear and tear put on them in that time ! Haven't even thought of replacing them with a different kind !
  I love the case and it suits my needs very well . I am a road warrior and I carry a lot of documents and manual etc . The only thing I can say negative is that there is no optional shoulder strap . There are times that you just can't roll it and when that happens if you have the case loaded up it is not really manageable to carry it by the handle . I would definitely buy again and [ .. ] was awesome
  I returned this product twice ; once for a replacement and the second time for a refund . My research pointed to this camera as being able to meet my needs , however it did not . One was a feature oriented problem , in that it took way too long to cycle between photos . I missed some really good memories at my son 's high school graduation because of that . More importantly , both cameras had lens problems that manifested in opaque circles showing up in photos that had a solid background . Sorry , but this camera just did not make the grade . I ended up with a Canon .
  I was very disappointed with this item . The biggest problem that I had was that the CD pockets are actually NOT designed to let you hold the booklets as well - in fact , they didn't even fit into mine . So if you are planning to only carry 52 CDs , and keep the booklets , don't buy this case . Additionally , it did not feel very robust compared to other CD cases I have owned .
  This worked very well for the first 2 weeks . Then for some reason it would only play music out of the left speakers . I verified that the Kensington was to blame after getting the same result in 3 other cars .
  I 've never had so much trouble with DVD-R media as with these . I 've used about a third of my spindle , and at least half of them had to be thrown away because of media errors . I thought TDK made bad discs , but these really take the cake . Never , ever buying these again . Save yourself a lot of hassle and frustration and avoid these discs .
  I was looking for a UV filter to protect the front element of my brand new expensive macro lens , so I wanted one that was top quality . Doing research , it always came back to B + W being the top of the line , so I decided I would spend a bit more to ensure quality . In the past I have only used Hoya multi-coated filters with satisfactory results . On those , my personal testing showed any image degradation was essentially nonexistent , but just noticeable under heavy scrutiny . Pulling this B + W filter out of the package , I almost worried for a second that the glass had fallen out of the frame . The glass was that significantly clear . Under normal room lighting conditions , I couldn't see any reflections off the filter unless I caught the reflection of a light bulb . I tested my lens with and without the filter , and I wasn't able to find any differences in image quality . The threads sat very nicely , and I have had no issues whatsoever . A good filter ( for protection purposes ) is the one that you don't even know is there , and this one definitely meets that criteria . If you spend a lot of money on a nice lens , I think it is worth it to spend a few more bucks on one of these excellent filters to protect your investment .
  This bag is perfect for securely carrying a 17-inch HP laptop . There are pockets galore to hold computer accessories , other necessary files or papers , or office supplies . Strong straps , easy to clean , lightweight , comfortable to carry . I am VERY pleased with this bag .
  This is a lightweight , well padded backpack that is truly amazing how much you can fit inside - all of my lenses , flash , camera , extra supplies , rocket blower , etc .. amazing ! I used a lowepro 220 slingbag until this one - but this fits almost twice as much , at about the same weight . You won't be disappointed . ONE WARNING : The CANON logo on the bag advertises you have a camera and expensive equipment inside - do not use in dangerous areas where there are pickpockets or other unsavory characters . You might want to put a button or sticker over the Canon Logo if using the bag for travel . Don't leave it lying around in an airport , a train station , or a library .
  Color and look was alright , but I had to return it since it was tight for the camera .
  We just bought this router , but we are Mac users and it only comes with a PC disc . A call to customer service didn't help . Can this be set up with a Mac ?
  It 's hard to believe that you can purchase so much performance for less than $ 40 . This little radio has the ability to fill a large room with undistorted sound from any of its 12 bands . Moreover , it is quite easy to use . Sensitivity and voice clarity are remarkable . The automatic gain control deals nicely with weak and strong signals . Selectivity is quite good , but one could use a larger tuning knob ( or I suppose in my case , smaller fingers ) to make those fine adjustments easier . The size of the radio makes it easy to pack . Although you get a lot of radio for a few dollars , it would have been nice if Sangean had included an AC adaptor . I have used this radio a lot since I purchased it , and it does have a hardy appetite for batteries when played at high volume . Accordingly , I purchased an AC adaptor for it . I tried several adaptors before I settled on the Radio Shack 4.5 volt " International " model ( cat . no . 273-1759 ) . This device accepts almost any input voltage and frequency and produces a full amp of filtered , regulated DC . Unlike other adaptors I tried , this one is relatively " quiet . " It does not induce hum or electrical noise . Best of all , it folds up in a very small travel package . If you don't want to spend a lot of cash on a multi band radio , but want to be able to listen to stations wherever you may travel , the SG622 should work well for you .
  I think the product is fine . It works OK with most computers I 've tried . However , Windows 98 and 98se do not " understand " USB drives natively . You have to install drivers . I don't blame the manufacturer for that , so the product is still worth 4 stars . As a side-note , you may find this particular hard drive enclosure to be slightly better than some others , because it can be fully USB-powered . So , no need for a power cord ( although one is available , optionally ) .
  My 80 year old mom , deaf in one ear , swears by it . She no longer has to keep the tv cranked up to ear-splitting volume . The neighbors are grateful , too .
  I got this to stop getting up all the time to change disks in my single DVD player . Now I 'm getting up lots more trying to get this to work . Other reviews say it 's slow to respond - they aren't kidding . Push " open " to access the tray and it grinds away for ten seconds deciding what to do . More often than not it 'll stay closed and go back to the movie . Sometimes ( not often ) it freezes completely and has to restarted . Being cheap , it doesn't remember where it was and you have to scan through the movie to find your place . Also ultra susceptible to scratches / fingerprints so the picture stops and jumps frequently . Avoid like the plague .
  First , the bad : the surface scratches easily , so I would recommend that you buy a screen protector ( tip : instead of buying " custom " protector for $ 15-20 per one set , buy a generic set and cut it to match : $ 5 for three that produce about 6 sets ) . It comes standard with only a USB cable as a way to charge it . There are not as many accessories for it as there are for the iPod yet . That 's it , I do not have any other negative comments on the Zen M.Now , the good : a ton and I have owned it for more than three months . The screen is ten times better that any screen I have seen on an iPod or any other mp3 player ( I have owned two myself ) . After watching your first movie on it , you will swear that the resolution specs listed are wrong : the quality is unbelievable and watching a movie is a breeze , don't be fooled by the size . The file formats : one thing that Apple does not necessarily advertise is the fact that they use proprietary formats ; and the fact that you may need third party software to get YOUR OWN songs out of the iPod . The Zen M ? No problem , this thing plays almost anything you throw at it and you can move the files anywhere you want . Oh yeah , you can use it as a portable hard drive too and have all of your precious spreadsheets , presentations , documents , etc . on it . The sound quality is excellent , even though I would recommend upgrading the headphones if you are picky . I also tested it with my Bose noise cancelling home set and this thing surpassed all my expectations . The Zen M comes with several different desktop themes from which you can choose . Any picture that you store on the device can also be set up as the wallpaper . You can also create slideshows , rotate photos , zoom in , etc . The menus can be rearranged in almost any way you want and you can even remove items that you don't use from your main menu items . The battery life blew my mind . During one week , I used it every day at work ( not for the full 8-9 hours , mind you ) , watched a movie during two lunch breaks , and had juice left on Friday evening . In short , I love it .
  I am having the same issue as the former reviewer using this drive with an aluminum Powerbook ( Mac ) .. well , not using it is more accurate . I purchased the thing this afternoon because I needed to transfer work to my laptop for tomorrow .. it 's now 2:40 in the morning and I can't get the info off of the drive , so I will be up the rest of the night burning DVDs instead . Ugh . They really need to provide better documentation and note that it is too low powered for ( certain ? ) laptops .
  It didn't last as long as my other ones have . For the price , it lasted long enough - over a year . Wish they had this is a wider variety of colors though .
  It 's a simple item , but it 's great for taking portraits or any time you need to put the camera on a tripod / keep it perfectly still . It 's small , so you can hide it in your hand while taking a self protraint and it clips to the camera strap so you 'll never lose it . Very happy with it .
  I purchased the Hot Link Pro system to hide all of my components in a closet behind the TV . The product was very easy to setup . It took maybe 5 minutes and works with my Sony receiver ( newer model ) , and Directv dvr / hd receiver . The eye for the Hot Link pro is behind the wall mounted tv and isnt even showing . There isnt any delay when I press a button on the remote like I was expecting to have either .
  The mount arrived today and .. MADE IN CHINA . Please be aware that the design of the product is good . It indeed installs quite easily in my corner configuration and it can support the 55 in television fine . But for this price , the last thing I expected was a marginal product in a damaged drop-shipped box made out of that cheap cardboard from a low-cost Chinese manufacturing plant . The quality of the mount is very questionable - they clearly used heavy gauge metal and the articulating joints are quality made , but the remainder is exactly what you are thinking of when you imagine something manufactured inexpensively in China . For instance , the tilt adjustment knob was stripped right out of the box . On a $ 600 piece of equipment I expect them to at least put a person at the end of the assembly line checking for defective product , this is ridiculous . The lateral rotation is mickey-mouse as well , a single pot-metal bolt " bearing . " The frame was misassembled out of the box , luckily I checked for plumb before drilling holes or the bottom bolts would have missed the studs . I shouldn't have to rebuild a product right out of the factory packaging like I did . It wobbles and clanks when moved around so I don't do it . Basically it is equivalent to a mount that costs 1/3 the price . I wish I had put a 2x8 across the corner and purchased a cheap flat mount from a box store instead . I didn't know that " high-end " mounts have such ghastly quality . I guess no one makes anything better so save your money and buy a cheap one , this is one case where it actually IS the same thing .
  After excellent review from friends I decided to purchase the adaptor . tried to install it on 5 different computers and kept getting the message that it was not a recognized device . Call Lynksis customer service , hours of waiting time , finally able to chat with someone and after some test recommended to return the item as it was broken
  Cables arrived ahead of schedule . Cables worked great .. quality cable and connectors . I ordered other cables from C2G and all worked well . I even ordered wrong cables ( my mistake ) and they sent me what I should have ordered in quick return . These cables and C2G are nice to work with
  Like several other reviewers , my autofocus quit . Nikon service made it sound like they 'd never heard of the problem . When I mentioned how many other people were writing about a similar problem , the response was the same : " what problem ? " . I 've bought several Nikon 's over the years and have liked their service . I 'll shop other brands next time .
  This is a really great Palm for beginners or those who don't want something so high tech it takes days to figure everything out . I would have given this 5 stars but the only thing I didn't like about this was when you want to type you use your stylist on the abc area and you have to tap it quite a few times to get it to come on . Frustrating , but in all a great gadget .
  Great product . The big CON is the Garmin policies about their databases and their _ very _ poor support . I bought a microSD City Navigator and I can't register it ( the site doesn't allow it ) and I can't backup it ( copying the files doesn't work ) . The Garmin support gave me at least 10 different answers about this but no solution for the problem . If I lose the chip or it gets damaged ( as happened a few months ago with another chip ) I will have nothing . Also _ very _ bad is the fact that you can not update any info in the card . And there are many small errors ( things are constantly changing ! ) . - The compass and altimeter have to be calibrated to be reliable . - The unit is not water proof and doesn't floatIf you 're not considering using Garmin maps / cityNavigators , it 's a very good choice . If you need Garmin 's maps / cityNavigators , prepare youself to be frustated with very bad support and many small errors that you can not fix .
  i have use it for about 1 month . I just want to say that it 's a good GPS , but only one thing inconvenient is the screen 's a little small . If you try to look at it , you may lose control . The ship is fast , and Fedex doesn't work on Monday , so if you order on weekend , your order 'll come on Tuesday . They also require your signature .
  I could not get this to work with my 5G iPod Classic no matter what settings I tried .
  I just received this today ( 3/19/2011 ) and sadly I am going to have to return it . I bought this because someone posted a review stating that they installed it into their MacBook ; however , I should have read the specs regarding the size . This will absolutely NOT fit into a MacBook , so don't buy this for that purpose .
  Maybe I 'm new to this printer ink game but in my experience I get printer ink cartridges that have the electronic chip on them that allows you to insert them into a print so they start printing immediately . They do say in the title tag here WITHOUT CHIP , but I didn't pick up on it and just wanted to warn any future buyers that in order to get these to work you 'll have to use razor blades and double stick tape to transfer the electronic chip to these ghetto little ink cartridges . Canon doesn't make them and I doubt they 're even legal . What kind of third world company sells ink without an electronic chip . I give it an extra star for me being an idiot and not realizing that WITHOUT CHIP means without the essential printer ink cartridge electronic chip that all ink cartridges should have .
  I bought this as a gift for my grandson , and it failed on the first attmpt to use it - swallowed a VHS tape and would neither play nor eject it . The design concept is good , but quality control seems to be non-existent . Back to Sears it goes , and shame on them for carrying the line .
  This remote is easy to program . However , the buttons on this often stick . For instance if I want to enter 5 it will enter 55 . Or if I want to recall the previous channel it will go to the channel and immediately go back to the channel I was watching . A little annoying .
  They are good quality , not great . They perform well , they are priced right . I don't know what else to say other than yes I would buy them again .
  While the HP PhotoSmart C618 [ and its twin , the Pentax EI-200 ] are older cameras , they still have a lot of capabilities left to explore , with the addition of the Tiffen HP618AD adapter . Installation is as simple as it can be - place the adapter over the lens and camera body , and tighten the mounting screw on the bottom . [ See my product photos . ] The mounting screw uses the camera 's tripod socket for attachment , but the adapter replaces it with a new socket directly below the lens [ on-axis , where it should have been in the first place ] . Once installed , the adapter allows the use of a wide variety of 37mm filters and lenses , and since it seems that 37mm is a popular size for small camcorders , there is absolutely no shortage of generally inexpensive add-ons which can be used to augment the camera 's built-in features . Since the threads are standardized , any circular 37mm photo / video accessory probably will fit this adapter . [ I haven't found anything yet which doesn't fit . ] Some of the most interesting and useful possibilities come with the addition of aftermarket lenses . For example , while the camera has a minimum macro focus distance of about 10cm / 4 " , the addition of a + 10 macro diopter will decrease this distance by a factor of 10 , allowing much closer macro shots from about 1cm / 0.4 " away . Add a second + 10 diopter , and the focal distance is decreased by a factor of 20 ! Some extremely close-range macro shots can be achieved through the use of this adapter and an add-on lens or two , photos which would be impossible otherwise . There are also various wide-angle and telephoto lenses available , enabling one to capture a wider area than the camera could capture on its own , or to zoom in much closer than the camera 's 3x optical zoom would allow . If I have any complaint about this adapter , it is that it can interfere with composition and , in some cases , flash lighting . Circular vignetting - the appearance of a photo having been shot through a hole or tunnel - tends to occur in varying degrees with almost any accessory , and the more you mount , the worse it gets . The camera 's optical zoom can be used to reduce or eliminate vignetting effects , though sometimes not entirely , and this is when photo cropping becomes necessary . I would assume that one could use stepping rings to mount some larger filters - 46mm size , for instance - and that should take care of the vignetting problem . On the other hand , mounting an accessory with a diameter significantly larger than 37mm will also cause that accessory to partially block the camera 's viewfinder , and can also block the camera 's flash somewhat , causing a quarter-circle flash shadow in the bottom right area of the photo . In short , it is usually best to use this adapter in situations where the camera 's flash will not be required , or , at the very least , with only one or two relatively thin filters if you also wish to use the camera 's flash . All of this , however , is due more to the design of the C618 / EI-200 than to the design of the HP618AD adapter . When the adapter is installed and secondary lenses or multiple filters are being used , you ARE shooting through a tunnel , so a certain amount of vignetting is often unavoidable . [ Note that there is no vignetting if you do not have any accessories mounted to the adapter . ] Also , the camera lens , viewfinder , and flash are all relatively close together , so there is going to be some interference when certain accessories are added to the front of the lens - these cameras just were not originally designed to be used like this . Even with these issues , though , the HP618AD is still an invaluable additiion to any C618 / EI-200 owner 's kit , enabling one to expand creativity , add effects , get close , get wide , and generally do a lot of things that the camera can't do on its own . These cameras are not SLRs , but they are still capable of doing some rather spectacular things that one might not expect from what amounts to a point-and-shoot camera with a few manual controls . All you need is the Tiffen HP618AD .
  This fan came shipped in it 's original box , not within another box which was fine , saves on packaging . The item was easy opening and although it came with instructions I didn't need them to assemble due to minimal parts and common sense . The fan is not really a hard plastic , and the guard is also made of plastic but it is fairly quiet and really throws a lot of wind so I 'm satisfied . Will it last ? Time will tell . I think if it falls over it may be prone to breaking since it 's all plastic .. just don't tip it over .
  I got this install kit for my 95 Chevy S-10 Blazer , but once I opened it I immediately knew that it was the wrong one for my truck , just from the size of the area in my truck compared to the install kit . On the outside of the package and on the description says this will fit a 92 ' and up , but this is the wrong kit for my truck . Then when you look at the intruction booklet for my type of vehicle , it says this kit is for a 02 to 04 . Wish there was a better way to make sure that this type of kit will fit before ordering , now I gotta worry if the seller will accept the product after I opened it . Hopefully the wire harness I ordered is the right one . I wished I woulda just got this from somewhere it was easier to exchange .
  The garmin works well at navigating directions . If you should alter your course it will tell you all the directions you will need to get to your destination . I do like the not having to look at the map while driving to unknown places . The only cons I have had was loosing satellite signal during a heavy rainstorm and when there is a temperature change on the windshield the suction cup has come loose . Overall I do like this product but has a few flaws .
  How many of these little ear things have we all bought and lost ? Where do they all go ? I was a little wary of this brand , but they actually have great sound and bass response compared to others . I 'm going to buy some for my ungrateful children . It is possible they may like them .
  I thought I had already reviewed this purchase .. I ordered four sticks , got four sticks and tested them in a 1.3 GHZ P4 System overclocked and had no problems . I have a spare stick and expecvt no problemsThe price was great and the products worked as advertised .
  I was very surprised when the left channel stopped cancelling noise completely after a month of very little use . I didn't fly with these phones , or blast music through them . I quietly played jazz on my computer through them while I worked at home . Then the left phone cut out cancelling , and I hear a sound similar to a constant mild whoosh of air . I bought my wife a set at the same time , and hers still work . Although I believe Audio-Technica is a fine brand name , and I have used other headphones manufactured by them for 15 years at a time , these ATH-ANC7 broke on me , and I can't recommend them . I could not get a refund from Amazon either , as the warranty had expired .
  I just borrowed my friend 's Sony 101 to covert my analog footage to DVD and I thought that it worked great . After converting all my old analog home movies to DVD I thought I would take it out for a spin and see how well it records overall . It takes great pictures and allows you to save them directly to your DVD vs forcing you to download the images to your computer . I was also able to preview the video footage before I finalized the DVD . You also just hook the Camcorder up to the TV to view your films instead of downloading them to your computer . If you are more interested in watching your home movies vs editing them , then this could be a good camcorder for you .
  I bought these to use in my digital camera , an SD device that supports MicroSDHC with SD Adaptors . And these MicroSDHC cards worked fine - once I tested them in a friend 's adaptor . But the adaptors that came with this didn't work at all , which made the whole product useless to me . I contacted the seller ( Digital Media Source ) for a refund , and never heard back .
  I 'm a Photojournalist in Mexico , in my work borrow me a Mk IIN but the battery who came with the camera it was too old and lose the charge too fast . I think in buy one but here in Mexico are too expensive like 200 dlls or more and it 's impossible find a gereric . I order this item whit my family in usa , then they send me this to my house in mexico . i put to charge in my original canon charger and when i disconect one of the tiny tubes who came in the contact space broke 's and fall , the charger not charge de battery anymore , i try to fix it whit a cuprum litle tube for make contact and doesn't worki loose my mind and broke the battery ..
  A week after purchasing this keyboard ( Saitek Eclipse II ) , the N key would randomly stop working . I popped off the key and found that the gel pad underneath the keys wasn't aligned correctly . I was able to stuff something under the bottom of the N key to get it to strike the pin correctly . Problem solved . Another week or so later , the shift keys would intermittently act as if they were being held down . This wasn't a big deal though as it didn't happen that often . A few days later I noticed that the entire number pad would stop responding for a few minutes at a time . Then the arrow keys randomly started going by themselves . Then I started losing LEDs . After that more keys stopped functioning like the N key did originally . After I had had the keyboard for about six weeks , I e-mailed the manufacturer . After waiting two weeks for a response , I sent them another e-mail . Waited another week . Sent another e-mail . No response . I tried calling but could never get through , their phone line just kept referring me back to the website , which would in turn say to e-mail them about defective products . I ended up just pulling out my old $ 15 Logitech keyboard and tossing this one in the closet where it will never see the light of day again . I really want to try the Saitek Eclipse II , especially considering it has some glowing reviews , but I just don't think I want to risk throwing away another $ 60 .
  I found it next to impossible to get a good seal in the ear for me - which results in not so great sound .
  Worked great - Wish I had bought it sooner . - Be very careful about adding additional memory . The bad new is the Memory stick I bought was slightly off sized so I filed it to fit into the memory slot now the printer is dead and this was a waste of money as I had to buy a new printer .
  I felt compelled to write a review of the Orbit Optical after reading some of the negative comments . It has been an excellent product . Very dependable for many years . As for the ball " jumping " out it hasn't happened to me in all the years I 've had this one and I have never noticed a " dead spot " during use . Regarding " no scrolling " complaints , the Kensington Mouseworks software , when installed , does have a scroll feature that is activated by " chording " the left and right buttons . I got the Orbit Optical as a warranty replacement from Kensington for an older mechanical model that wore out . Great warranty support . I do a lot of CAD and graphics work and my hand is comfortable all the time . No chasing the mouse around the desktop . I do admit I use a Fellowes mouse pad with a built in wrist rest for more comfort and it keeps the Orbit from sliding around . My wife liked mine so much she ordered one for her Mac ( now she has two buttons that work ! ) .
  We have it in the baby 's room . When it 's on , and the water is flowing out of the tank , it makes too much of a bubbling sound and wakes up baby . We had it in our bedroom for a while , and it even woke me and my husband up throughout the night .
  Great product , but I 'm not crazy about the touch finger scroll . Overall , great product
  My friend has this printer and he says its horrible ! The print quality is awfull . Though , it 's speed is fast , this is a horrible quality printer . Two of my friends on Compaq computers . One put it in the garage a year ago and has been happy with his new one . My other friend suffers from having one with Windows 98 ( not to mention incredibly slow ) and is going to get a new one soon . Compaq I guess is just a horrible company .
  Bought this tv mainly because of it 's style . Grew tired of all the Black tv 's and the fact my living room color scheme is Carribean Flavored . I did however do all my homework and stuck with Samsung due to my last tv being of the DLP flavor ( which was wiped out by Hurricane Katrina ) . At first I really wasn't blown away and thought my previous tv looked a lot better when watching DVD 's . However , since then I 've hooked up my Playstation 3 and watched my first Blu-Ray Movies and WHOA ! Need I say more ..
  This battery ( EN-EL5 ) is a fake one . It came without the tridimensional signal and works for 10 clicks or 20 minutes in standby ( the original works for almost 300 clicks ) . FAKE , FAKE , FAKE ! IT 'S A SHAME !
  I would have hoped that my now Amazon would have switched to American made electronics . The adaptor works for now , but I expect that it will break or stop working within 6 months . That is about the length of time for Chinese made products to last . In the future , I would hope that Amazon would identify the country of origin for its electronics so that people could know whether the product was of adequate quality .
  Cable was delivered quite fast and works as expected for a very reasonable price .
  This monitor has a truly amazing picture at 1600x1200 , and the colors are great , too . With DVI , the picture is very stable and quite beautifulHOWEVER : If you are a hardcore gamer , pass this one up . Many people may disagree with this , but for me the ghosting is too noticeable and it is distracting and can actually detract from your gameplaying . For instance , if you play Unreal Tournament 2004 online , you need to be able to rotate the camera all the time while still retaining the ability to discern motion in the distance ( say , an enemy running at you ) . With this monitor the ghosting is just too much and it can seriously hinder your playing . However , everything else about it is good as far as LCDs go . For me , I am going to return this monitor and go with a ViewSonic 22 " CRT instead . It 's half the price and offers just as good a picture quality in my opinion . Plus , I like being able to run my monitor at any resolution without having to worry about interpolation . And , I 'll say it again - for me ghosting is a show stopper . Here 's a small experiment : try tracking the mouse pointer with your eyes in windows while moving it at various speeds . On this monitor is blurs easily . On a CRT it doesn't . If you are a gamer - stay away . For this price you can get a CRT that will blow this LCD out of the water . However , other factors such as the ergonomics of this monitor are pretty good ..
  I ordered laminating pouches , and I received laminating sheets instead . I am very disappointed .
  I recently purchased this card for my Canon FS100 , I only recently purchased the camera itself and this is the first card I have purchased for the camera , but so far it has worked well with my camera and I think this is a great product for the price .
  This book is totally useless for beginner . When you read it , you will feel very confused . There are not enough examples and the explanation is not clear . If you really want to learn C , I recommend you the book which called ' Beginning C ' by Ivor Honor . ' Practical C Programming ' is totally useless ! Don't buy it !
  I have been drooling over the idea of getting a GPS for awhile . I just moved to LA from Ohio .. HUGE DIFFERENCE when it comes to driving .. My car has been littered with Mapquest directions ever since I got here .. Well I did my research , and the TOMTOM GO has been praised almost EVERYWHERE . The packaging reminded me of the ipod , and it even comes with a case ! It comes with a suction cup mount ( which is what I use .. does and good job ) , but also a adapter so you can stick it more permanently on your dash . I have been driving a week now , and I can say it does a great job . Sometimes it doesn't always take my preferred way , but thats to be expected . Its 3d view is super cool , and it will make any passengers jealous and in awe . It also has a option to hook up to tomtom 's website and update it , I downloaded the " valley girl " voice on to my unit , so now my audio directions are " Up ahead , like , turn to the right or something .. " hehee .. funny . A recent update made the brightness higher , so the glare problem isn't as bad .. but it still could use a glareless screen ( I think you can buy protective screens for it , for Pocketpc 's , etc ) TomTom GO is not only a nice small sexy fun portable unit , it does a great job too .
  Great shots . Great size . Especially great shots in low light . Does everything promised .
  I bought this charger along with a PowerEx MH-C9000 charger expecting to play with them both and pick a winner . Although the Ansmann Energy 8 is about as far from the PowerEx as two devices can be , I have to admit that I do like them both . I 'm not going to say this is the best charger ever , because it is good for some types of people and usage , but not all . If you like simplicity then this is the charger for you . Each batter position has a red / green LED and that is the full status you get . Overall , it can display charging , refreshing , done , and bad battery . That 's it . There is no doubt that this charger generally does a good job under most conditions , but I take away one star because the info it gives you is so limited and because it offers absolutely no control . Its this 5 % of problem conditions that gives me some doubts that this charger is not perfect . Here are two examples . First a put a PowerGenix NiZn battery in this charger . These are pretty common and similar to NiMH but with a higher 1.6v voltage . I put them in my PowerEx charger and they register an error in a few seconds . The Ansmann acts like its charging it , but goes through a continuous charge and refreshing cycle which repeats over and over . True the charger never claims to charge these , but its easy to tell these aren't NiMH batteries by their higher voltage , so I feel they should be rejected as bad . The second questionable problem was what I observed with several NiMH batteries . This charger displays a red , yellow , or green indication of battery charge for 5 second when a battery is inserted . This indicates under 25 % charge , 25-80 % , and 100 % respectively . This is a nice feature , but on many occasions I have inserted a battery , gotten a yellow light indicating 25-80 % , then , within 30 seconds to a minute the ready light turns on . How can that be ? A partially charged battery can not fully charge in a minute . Impossible . I 've also seen many cases where I 've had a charging and fully charged battery next to each other , I remove the charged battery and the charging battery suddenly indicates its charged . I 've seen it occur too many times to beleive its just a coincidence . In any case these problems are minor , and in most cases , the charger seems to work great . Of course those cheapie chargers you get with a pack of batteries seem to work well as well , but I do expect more from a charger which costs much more . Still if you don't mind spending the bucks , and you want simple , this charger is great and fairly quick . The PowerEx charger is fantastic as well , and if you are willing to spend the time with it you will get even better results , but you just can't pop in the batteries and walk away , and some PowerEx modes can take up to 48 hours to complete , and to be honest , for slightly better results the time may not be worth it . Oh , one more thing . This is certainly NOT a travel charger . Its rather large , but it uses a cord and not a wall wart , which is nice . And the users guide could be better . But overall I 'm very happy with this charger , and the fact that my wife can use it with no training , is a big plus .
  Nice armband . Doesn't slide down your arm . I 'm very petite with small arms and this JUST makes it for me . You will sweat under the armband but that 's to be expected . Holds the iPod perfectly , and you can still press the buttons through the mesh front .
  I had two of these dvd players .. 1st one started erroring out with " bAD " showing on the display after about a month . My second unit errored out ( bAD ) after 3 days . I had previously had very good luck with toshiba , so I have no clue what they did with this machine .
  Very nice . Attractive and stylish . Fits in purse , very compact . Has good clasp , well made from good leather . Places for spare chips . Not one thing I was disappointed in . not disappointed in any thing about the case . You will be pleased with this product .
  A solid polarizer , nicely build and includes a small hardcase to store when not in use . If you are looking for a polarizer I can certainly recommend this one . I have been using mine for almost a year now , all across the Northern American Hemisphere , without problem . Before you buy it , make yourself a favor and read on its uses . Chances are you don't need it and are better of without it . Otherwise , go for it !
  The headset I received is not the one pictured . I don't think it is Amazon 's fault . I believe Belkin is the one that changed the headset and gave it the same product number . This one does not correctly fit in my ear like the other previous ones I have ordered .
  Installed the adapter in my older HP desktop in order to move it to my daughter 's room instead of running 60 plus feet of cable . The adapter was easy to install , fit perfectly and works just as advertised .
  I had this model surge protector and it does not clean or filter power ! Call monster cable and ask , you need the better models hts1000 , mkII 3500 , and better for power filtering or conditioning . Good quality surge protector , nice layout but not worth the extra cash , you can buy a just as good quality surge protector for around $ 25 bucks . DO NOT BE FOOLED OR FOOL YOURSELF INTO THINKING THIS SUREGE POTECTOR MAKES VIDEO OR AUDIO BETTER ! I 've seen other reviews thinking it did !
  The bag had very high ratings , so I purchased it . No doubt , it is a solid , well put together bag . I do not expect anything less from Wenger . I was a bit disappointed by the overly buly top part of the bag , but the other facets of the bag are so great I decided to keep the bag .
  i purchased the speaker for my grandson who lives with me and he liked it very much so i guess if he liked it then so do i . i was very satisfied with the speed of shipping . thank you
  This is my first Tiffen filter . I received it free as part of an Amazon promotion and I keep it on my Nikkor 55-200 lens . From the test shots I have taken with the filter on and off , I can see no change in my images or reduction in image quality with this filter , and that is what a UV protection filter should do . Also , it is extremely easy to clean , much more so than my multi-coated Hoya UV filter . Construction quality is excellent and I am quite pleased with this filter . If I were to purchase additional filters , I would definitely buy another Tiffen filter .
  .. but in this case an inferior product . There are better ones out there with more functionality and better quality .
  What better way to organize the digital photographs you have burned to CD ? I run thumbnails on 5x8 index cards and put them in the front of the sleeve in which each CD is stored . Just listing the filenames takes less space . Now I can find particular subjects or photos without having to slip each CD into the drive or writing all over the CD itself . I also like it for it 's original intent .. to store DVDs compactly . What 's in each album ? I use a commercial labeler ( i.e. P-Touch ) which sticks just fine and helps me organize the various albums .
  The Good : Small , lightweight , inexpensivedecent soundThe Bad : The battery life on this thing is awful . In under two hours the thing is completey drained . This is made worse by the fact thateven when it 's " off " it still has an active display , furtherdraining the single AA batteryInterface is not intuitive ( then again what do you expect for something this small ) Headphones . Simply put , they stink . Those people with large ears may find them perfect though . Memory size is limited , and not upgradeable . Conclusion : The mini-yepp is an expensive , decent piece of equipment . Howeverit 's not worth the money . Its performance does not meet the specifications that are outlined in the product description and Iwould advise anyone looking for an mp3 player to avoid this modelunless they have money to burn .
  This player is the worst for the following reasons : 1 . Slow to start . 2 . No bookmark / audio resume feature3 . Do not play files by foler order . I have 10 folders , each has mp3 files named 1 . mp3 , 2 . mp3 , etc without albums or artist info . And I can't play them by the folder order . 4 . It supports FAT32 , but guess what , pop in a FAT32 4G SD , and it doesn't work5 . Amazon do not take mp3 player return
  A reasonable price and pretty good free shipping .. even to Hawai'i . Much better than the I-pod and will integrate well into future firmware Microsoft updates . It 's the ease of use that will make you smile . The video and audio are very good . How am I ever going to fill it with my favorite audio and video ? I don't think I can , but it will be fun trip to take .
  This item produces a pleasant effect and adds very nice lighting to the party . It has good sound sensitivity . However , the cons outweigh : 1 . Duty cycle 10 min means you need to buy two and also automatic timer-switches for the outlets . That triples the cost at least . 2 . The damned thing heats like an iron - it is not safe , if within reach , especially if kids are around . 3 . It is 600W - probably more power than all your house lighting together . Count in the energy cost . 4 . The power cord is very short ( 3 ft ? ) , and there 's no on / off switch . So you will likely need extension cords with a switch too - or unplug the unit every time to switch it off . 5 . It is bulky : this mushroom is about 18 " tall and 12 " in diameter . After some research , I 've found there are many LED or laser lighting options under $ 100 , which are under 10W power consumption , have no duty cycle requirements , won't burn you . Chauvet min lasers will even fit in your pocket . So , from my point of view , this is an antiquated product .
  Antonline has the 256mb card for this price . Advertising should be corrected as it is not correct .
  I have 4 of these now . They take up less room than keeping all the cases for the movies , games , and music . The website to organize all your items is user friendly and you can print your list many different ways .
  I purchased this device after running my boat aground on a sand bar . I was going very slow and didn't damage my boat . I would not advise installing it yourself unless you are very capable . I drove my car and boat to Best Buy and their marine installer did a fine job . It works great and warns me of any hiding sand bars .
  I 've become convinced there is a timer or expiration mechanism on the ink cartridge usage on this device . I didn't notice right away because I used the device a lot and it seemed OK . But my usage has waned and here is what happens : I replace all cartridges and print two pages . 3 months later I go to print 2 more pages and it claims the ink is half gone . 2 months later I print one more page and it claims the cartridges are empty and need to be replaced . 7 PAGES AND THE CARTRIDGES ARE EMPTY ! I ignore the empty warnings for another dozen pages or so before I break down and buy new cartridges . This is still terrible performance . I 've now read on other forums if you ignore the empty warnings long enough the whole device will lock up and become unusable . I will never buy another Canon product .
  I had another Sony VAIO for 8 years and never had a problem . This one arrived and seemed to be fine , but when I tried to use Outlook I started getting funny error messages . I called support and was diagnosed with a corrupted hard drive . I debated then whether to return it , but since I 'd had such a good experience with Sony before .. I sent it in . Didn't get it back for 28 days ( normal is 7-10 days ) . They had to replace the motherboard , a fact my repairs slip did not record - I found that out talking to a Sony tech when I was hunting it down . All in all a bad experience , the only good thing about this was Amazon , which gave me a refund .
  Do not buy this television . I purchased my TV in 12/07 after a few years of waiting for HDTV to become more affordable . $ 1700 was a lot of money , but foolish me thought the spluge would at least be worth it in the long run . My Toshiba , 32 inch stereo televison , that I " splurged " on in 2003 is still working with everyday use in my bedroom , but not my Samsung HDTV.I searched the internet and found out that one of the probelms that seemed to fit was that the television was manufactured with underrated capacitors . I purchased 2 new capacitors and replaced the old bulging ones . That worked for about 3 months and then the lines of dots started to come back . It is intermittent now . Sometiimes there is no visible problem , other times the dots will appear when I first turn it on , but if I turn off and back on , they 'll be gone and the TV will be fine for a few days . I think it is horrible that you can spend so much money on a television that doesn't provide more than 3 years of useful life . I wish I could attach a picture . Do not buy this television and be suspect of any other Samsung model .
  Magnavox 37MF231D 37 " Widescreen LCD HDTV with HDMIMy husband and I purchased this TV from Sam 's Club about 15 months ago . It died last week and is in the junk pile behind the TV service shop I took it to . The service repairman explained that companies were required by law to provide parts to repair their products but they do not have to now . I am extremely disappointed that this TV , whose manufacturer 's name I trusted , died so soon when other TV 's we have had and still have are going strong .
  Excellent headphones . This is the 5th set of headphones I 've gone through and I 'll be sticking with these for awhile for a few reasons . First , they 're durable and made to last . The headband is padded and strong and won't snap , warp , or bend . The cups are very secure . And , most importantly , the single wire config is well protected , especially at the point of connection on the cup . Second , the sound is excellent . Very clear and crisp . I mean VERY CLEAR and CRISP . The sound really surrounds the ear because of the 50mm cups which really adds to encompassing you in the music . I used to have a problem with the bass , but then I found out that it was the source of the music that made the bass shallow ( my laptop ) . When I went to a different source ( my walkman ) I really knew what they meant by the Brainshaker Technology . These headphones are not very good at filtering out external noises , but I don't mind , in fact I prefer it that way . I like to know what 's going on around me .
  I originally considered the InFocus X1 , since it is highly rated and probably ' the ' most recommended projector in this price range . However , I am sensitive to the ' rainbow ' effect ' that DLP projectors are prone to , so I had to turn to LCD . The NEC VT46 has some favorable reviews out there , and it has a shorter throw than the X1 , so I decided to pick one up . Wow ! The picture is much better than I expected ! Despite being a 4:3 projector , it produces an amazing picture with widescreen DVDs . The colors look very natural and the contrast is excellent . The short throw lens and manual zoom allow me to create a huge image from the coffee table , and it 's also very quiet so it doesn't intrude on quiet scenes . I don't hesitate to recommend this projector ; It has exceeded my expectations .
  I purchased the Flip Video after reading about it in a local paper . It has been great fun taking video of life events we never would have captured if we had to carry our bigger camera . It is so small and light weight , it is easily carried in my purse . The video quality is remarkable , even in dimly-lit situations . The zoom takes some practice . Very good sound quality . I had no trouble downloading the clips to my Mac . The 60 minute version allows more video time away from a computer for down-loading .
  Five stars for a good reason ! I got this at a great price and it 's just what I called for . The drive is fast and clearly built to last , I 'm confident it 's not going to fail on me , not only because of the excellent construction but also the warranty , which is ten years . The drive comes with a short extension cable and a dog tag with the corsair logo on it . Why ? I don't know , but freebies are always fun . The only issue I might have with the drive is it 's size , I knew it wasn't a small drive , it 's the price you pay for it 's near indestructible design . However any issues with closely situated USB ports can be solved with a little common sense , and also the extension cable helps . I carry this puppy around in my pocket all day and I know it 'll be with me for a while .
  This item was advertised with an MP4 I purchased and didn't fit the MP4 . Useless .
  This drive worked beutifully in the first 6 months in on of our school research laboratories , regardless of the infrequent unexplained miscommunication with the PC . After they trusted it for work and research data backup , done just once every 2 weeks , it suddenly gave clicking sounds and stopped working . After extended agony with the customer support , they simply got nothing . Surperisingly , when they talked about this subject with some of our collegues in our University , they discovered that many of us , in defferent departments , suffered from the same problem with different models of the Wistern Digital external hard drives ( USB / Firewire ) . After all the frustration and the torture with this piece of junk , I can say for sure , Buy WD if you are looking for the best machine to lose your data ? Beleive me when I say Western Digital Hard Drives are absolutely the worst for your data storage . We 've been there before .
  I have been a long-time advocate of LaCie . I snubbed my nose at the nay-sayers who complained of the drives . i even doubted that customer service could be this bad . well , i 've come around . I own 6 LaCie Drives . 3 have failed me in the last 4 months . LaCie won't take them back , though the did take one in for service , claim the rattling sound of the fan or something was normal , and send it back to me . granted , they called , but only once and they didn't wait to hear back from me before returning the drive unfixed , and i had to pay one-way shipping ! i am DONE WITH LACIE . when i told them i 'd lost my data , they said i should have had it backed up . wait ! that 's what this drive was for ! sorry guys . but i 'm done . [ .. ] Amazon has been very helpful and they are going to help me in any way they can . Props for Amazon . but don't buy LaCie . as the last review i read told me before i purchased it anyway , " it 's not a question of if this drive will fail , but when . "
  This antenna works great for local digital channels . I 'm only abour 10 miles from the towers , so the reception is fantastic - even with it mounted IN the attic ! Mounting it outdoors should also get great reception at further distances , but for anything over 20 miles , I 'd probably get their larger antenna ( same type ) . The best thing was there was virtually no assembly required with this antenna . It took me less than 10 minutes total to remove my old antenna and install this one . I 'm extremely satisfied with this product !
  I read a lot of bad reviews before I bought it , but it works great . Sure if you dont know much about mp3 players it may take some getting used to but works great .
  POSTED 09/27/04 : I purchased this unit about three weeks ago and so far , overall , I have been very happy with it . Below are some things I really like and dislike about the Panasonic VCR / DVD Recorder . LIKES : 1 . DVD-RAM : CHASE feature . With this feature , similar to a DVR , you can start watching the program that is being recorded before it has finished recording OR you can watch another program on the same disc . Chase also allows you to pause live TV , backup to see something again , etc . Chase mode even works when dubbing tapes . If you are one of those people , like me , that is constantly backing up the tape to see / hear something again , this will save wear and tear on the VCR . 2 . DVD-RAM : 1.33x playback . It speeds up the audio , but doesn't change the pitch . Not really suitable for movies or dramas , but it does allow you to quickly watch news and documentaries . With this feature and skipping commercials I can watch an hour long documentary in just over 30 minutes . 3 . DVD-RAM : Easy trimming and editing of recordings allows you to cut out commercials and make more room on the disc . Shows can be divided too and chapter marks added . 4 . DUBBING : Easy and clean dubbing VHS to DVD . Just cue and pause the tape and then when you hit DVD record it starts the recording and unpauses the tape at the same time . Only a couple frames of the paused image get recorded . Commercials can be removed this way too if you want to take the time . VCR on-screen messages are suppressed when recording , so you don't have to worry about a " PLAY " becoming part of your recording . I actually find this manual method of dubbing better than the ONE-TOUCH dubbing option , which doesn't give as much control . This also works for DVD to VCR dubbing , but the procedure is a bit more complicated . 5 . You CAN record two shows at once , one to the VCR and the other to DVD . However , you can only do one TUNER ( Channel # ) recording at a time , so one or both recordings must be via AV inputs . 6 . Remote control of the VCR and DVD is mostly the same . 7 . The clock seems to keep accurate time , having gained only about 3 seconds in 3 weeks . 8 . VCR : A VP recording speed which is 5x longer than SP and doesn't look much worse than EP . With VP speed you can record 13h 20m + on a T160 or 16h 40m + on a T200 . Not compatible with most other VCRs though . 9 . VCR : 35x search mode . Clean picture with little noise too . 10 . VCR : Super fast Rewind and also a Jet Rewind , both take less than a minute to rewind a T160 tape . DIS-LIKES : 1 . No digital zoom on DVD Player . I have poor vision and the zoom feature on my last DVD player allowed me to see small print without getting closer to the TV , so I really miss the zoom feature ! 2 . The manual is confusing and dis-organized ( see 02/19/05 update ) , but it is also complete so I suggest reading it from cover to cover . 3 . No frame advance on the VCR , just pause and slow motion . And the slow motion is awkward to use . 4 . Many features only available on DVD-RAM . ( Do download the manual from Amazon and look at the RAM DVD-R , etc . headers to see what recording formats each feature supports . ) 5 . CD-Audio playback is too loud and muffled and sounds terrible , at least on my TV . It could be my TV , but output from DirecTV as well as TV , DVD , VHS and MP3 playback from this unit all sound great on the same TV . 6 . Quality of LP and EP DVD recordings is really bad during scenes with smoke / steam / fog . Scenes with fast motion also cause some digital artifacts too . However , these could be problems with all DVD Recorders in general and not just the Panasonic . Anyway , despite the above problems I am really pleased with this unit . The pluses definitely outweigh the negatives . Unless something better comes on the market I would get another one if I needed a second VCR / DVD recorder * UPDATE 02/19/05 : * Having used this unit for several months now I just want to add that I still find it to be an excellent machine . The Time-Slip ( simultaneous record and play and chasing playback ) have changed how I watch TV . I rarely watch a program live anymore , or when I do , I wait until it is about 1/3rd over so I can watch it in chase mode and skip the commercials . The flexible recording mode has been wonderful for recording programs and copying tapes to DVD-R . Flexible Recording calculates the necessary bitrate to fit a recording on a disc at the best possible quality . Many recorders limit you to fixed rates , such as 2 or 4 hours . With FR , if a program or tape is 2 hours and 10 minutes long it can be recorded at near SP ( or 2 hour ) quality instead of having to be recorded at a noticeably lower quality . While Flexible Recording is not available for One-Touch Dubbing , it can easily be done manually . Just tune to the " TP " ( tape ) channel before starting Flexible Recording . I 've found that many commercial tapes can be copied . Don't assume like I did at first that none can . Use a DVD-RAM disc or scrap DVD-R to do some test recordings of all your tapes and see which you can backup to DVD-R . More than 50 % of the tapes I own can and don't give the copy protected message . For time-shift recording I recommend you get some double sided DVD-RAMs in cartridges . The cartridge protects the discs from dirt and dust which can cause write errors . While you do have to flip the discs to use the other side , a double sided cartridge takes up no more room than a single side cartridge or two single sided non-cartridge DVD-RAMs . If you need to record more than 4 hours and can't change discs and don't want to record to DVD in EP mode , you can use the VCR too . VHS may be a step backwards from DVD , but VHS-SP looks a lot better than DVD-EP . The VHS recording can then be copied to another DVD-RAM for editing . Regarding the manual , if you buy this unit then be sure to download the manual from Amazon . You can then use the PDF viewer to search for the feature or function you need to learn how to use . Trust me , it 's a lot quicker to fire up the computer than trying to find what you want to know in the printed manual . * UPDATE 10/6/05 * The manual says that timer recordings cannot be executed on both DVD and VHS at the same time and that timer recordings can not overlap . However , I discovered recently that this is not true . Two timer recordings can be made simultaneously , provided they are not from different channels . You can record L1 and L2 at the same time or a combination of either L1 or L2 and a tuned channel . I 've also discovered that if you are recording to DVD-RAM and are not playing a title then hitting Time-Slip will begin playback at 30 seconds from the end of the recording . This is a useful feature when you have the TV on in the background and have one of those " What was that ? " moments . :)
  Purchased this camera recently . A great value when I bought it if you look at features vs . price . Quality of photos very good . Easy to set up camera but you need to make sure the lens cover is fully open to turn camera on . I had trouble understanding how the software communicates with the camera . The docs were not helpful and it looked like I had some kind of communication issue . I email'ed support and got a prompt response . Basically , with Windows ME some of the functions are not required and do not work , eg image transfer via menu item . The software itself is pretty sparse in terms of image editting capability , luckily I have some better software that came with my .. Visioneer scanner . Overall , very happy but they should improve docs and add some more software .
  Encountered some serious ghosting issues with the UV filter when taking pictures that included a light source . Honestly I was taken back by the reviews here and should have known that a $ 6 piece of glass would perform sub-optimally . I immediately took this off my 50mm lens . Would I recommend this ? Not in am million years . At $ 6 I won't be returning it , the hassle of shipping for $ 6 just isn't worth it .
  I 've had my camera for a little over a week now and LOVE it ! I haven't played w / every single feature but have tested quite a few settings , zooming and such . I only have produced a few blurry shots .. other than that , the shots are crystal clear ! They looked great on the camera as well as when I upload them onto my computer . Also as a side note ( since I 'm a graphic designer ) , I always put the pics I take into photoshop to touch things up and to do auto levels . I barely need to touch the photos . Some needed a little help w / the lighting but I was very impressed ! The video part of the camera works wonderful as well . So far , I 've just taken videos of my puppy doing his tricks . They turn out wonderfully and look awesome playing the videos back on the computer . The only drawback I have seen thus far is not knowing when the battery is going to die .. until right beforehand . That happened to me while I was at my company 's winter party . Since the charger is farily compact .. I will remember to bring it w / me when I goes places ( the battery does last quite awhile ! ) I also bought the SanDisk 1 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card and it works fabulous ! It holds a multititude of pics as well as video and uploads to my computer easily and quickly . I am using the camera for personal pics as well and taking pics to use for my job . I highly recommend this camera :D
  I bought a pair of these for myself and later another pair for my wife . These headphones are of excellent quality and sound great . The noise canceling feature is perfect for listening to music on long plane trips . Although a little big , they are quite comfortable and I think the over-the-ear design cuts out more noise than other headphones . I highly recommend these for anyone looking for some peace and quiet .
  This is a very useful flash . I never use any of its custom functions or manual controls . I just use flash exposure compensation and / or ISO on the camera to control its output . I get great results . The flash just works with plenty of power to fill up a big room with light and it 's significantly smaller than the sigma ef500super and the 580ex . Also , I used to use rechargeable batteries , but too many of them , even name brand ones , would stop charging reliably . So I switched to using alkaline Duracells and they work equally as well as the rechargeables , give about the same amount of flashes and the flash recycles even Faster with alkalines than 2700mah rechargeables . Hard to believe , but that 's my observation . This a good flash for its size and price . One thing they left out is a way to trigger this flash optically with another flash .
  Easy to install , but after about 6 months it started only working intermittently . Finally broke around 7 months , hard drive would turn on but not be recognized in any computer I tried it in ( included ones that it worked in the day before ) . I got a silver one for a couple bucks so I guess you get what you pay for , but you are better off just buying a better one . Also the USB Type A as the connector for the hard drive is pretty stupid . Why not just use a miniUSB like every other external drive I have ever seen ?
  I have only had my Nano for a few days , but I LOVE it ! My boyfriend got it for my for my b-day and loved it so much he got himself one ! I was so amazed with the small size and how incredibly light weight it is . So far I have about 700 songs downloaded onto it . I recommend getting the car stereo adaptor which I have and it is amazing ! Now , one reviewer said something about the Nano being flimsy and it will break if you drop it . Obviously you need to take care of this device and if you 're clumsy and drop it then you deserve to have it break . As for the scratches on the screen , I have not removed the protective plastic that is on my Nano to protect it from well scratches . If you have removed that protective plastic , simply go to Radioshack or another electronics store and ask for PDA protectors . They come in sheets of 4 and you can cut them to if the Nano screen and vioila ! Insta-scratch protector ! Like I said , I have only had mine for 5 days but so far I am in love !
  I bought these because it seemed that they had some really good reviews among other phones in this price range . I was thoroughly disappointed . The sound seemed good enough for headphones at this price . The sound was warm and seemed accurate . But that was the only positive in these headphones and the only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of one . Now for the bad .. First of all , the sound isolation really isn't very good . I couldn't use them in the studio because my drum mics were picking up the mix I had going through them . On that same note , it was impossible to rehearse with them because they didn't block very much of my drums , therefore having to turn the mix up really loud to hear over the drums , which defeats the purpose of isolation headphones to help save my hearing . Which brings me to my next point ; they don't get very loud , which could either be good or bad . Good for long term hearing 's sake , but bad for loud playing situations . Also , they are very cheaply built . They got stepped on in the studio ( not very hard mind you ) and where the phone connects to the headband broke . In other words , these are probably great headphones for somebody hoping to just listen to music through them , or maybe a reference headphone for a studio engineer . However , I would not recommend them to anybody who tours , anybody who is rough on their equipment , or any loud instrumentalists ( drummers ) . In this price range I 'll go back to my Vic Firths .
  I honestly don't know how I lived without my iPod ! I debated between the Nano and this one because I had heard that the video wasn't supposed to be very clear and I couldn't imagine that I would want more than 2 GB of songs . I am so glad that I picked this one ! Unless it 's in really bright light , the video is very crisp and I love watching T.V. shows that I missed while I am taking the train to work . In addition to loading all of my CD 's onto it , I have downloaded videos , songs and podcasts . Although it 's still only about 1/3 full , I obviously would have filled the nano right away . There are only three things that I don't like : 1 ) Even though I keep it in a case , the screen somehow became scratched ; 2 ) The headphones are a little too big for my ears and the foam covers fall off easily ; and3 ) Apple should provide the cord to allow you to charge it using a wall outlet . Other than these minor issues , it is a fabulous product and I am very happy I took the leap !
  Not Nikon , cheap knock-off , passed off as original Nikon cap . Spend the extra three or four bucks to get factory Nikon cap with free shipping ! ( shipping was more expensive than this cap )
  I bought a sharp lcd tv from j & r in new york last Jan , after a year and half , when powering on the tv , sometimes works , sometimes not . after unplug in , wait for a while and plug back , worked for a couple months . Send it to service center to checkup , was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced . when request to get back the replaced lcd control board , was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board , it has to be shipped back , otherwise , you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board .. it 's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor .. But , if you do want to get a sharp , better get a long long warranty ..
  I was impressed with the canon 's sd600 's size and simple features . However , the camera struggled to take quality pictures and color saturation was low . I took pictures side by side with my old Canon A70 and a Sony Powershot .. and even the 3.2 megapixel images looked better . The quality of the lens or something in my camera was off and I returned it . It may have been my individual one , but I 'm looking elsewhere . Not impressed .
  Like many others , when my Rio Karma died and replacements were not available , I ended up shopping around and getting this player . Overall , I am very pleased with the device . It looks great , is easy to use overall , sounds great , and the pictures add to the cool factor . My only two complaints about the device itself would be that you cannot delete tracks directly from the player ( you have to use software through your PC ) and that scrolling through music only displays title information ( not artist / album , like on the Karma ) . Neither of those are deal killers , but I do miss the features . My main gripes are with the software support and documentation . The documentation is weak to start with , and not translated well into English . Some of it is indecipherable . Read it through once to get necessary tidbits , then put it aside and play with the device to figure the rest out . As for the software support , I don't like the fact that they bundled it with Napster Lite rather than either something proprietary ( that worked better ) or better integration with Windows Media Player 10 ( WMP10 ) . It is fairly well supported through WMP10 , but it 's not comprehensive . For example , it synchronizes the software well but doesn't copy or synchronize playlists - you 'll need the Napster software for that ( argh ! ) . I did have one little problem . When I first loaded my library to the device ( about 1200 songs ) , many of them ( about 25 % ? ) didn't load with the right genre . That is , the genre in the ID3 tag might be " Reggae " but the device would display it as " ( 16 ) . " Some would load fine , others wouldn't . This was a problem with both Napster and WMP10 , so I don't think it was the player directly . I tried re-entering the genre through WMP10 , but it still didn't work . When I used Moosic Organizer to re-write the tags , it worked ! I simply re-synced the player with WMP10 after re-entering the tag info and they all loaded just fine . The photo album is cute , but not terribly useful . The display is large , by mobile device standards , but still small compared to your monitor , or paper pictures . Still , it 's fun to have some pictures on the device to share and the display is very good , despite the size . The device works great as an external hard drive to your PC . You need a special cable to connect the device to a PC ( it 's not a normal USB cable on the device end ) , but it functions very well and allows you to use that storage for something other than pictures and music . Finally , the USB host feature should be very handy for people who have compatible cameras . I haven't gotten my favorite digital camera ( a Sony ) to work yet , but others seem just fine . I 'm sure more support with come down the road . Overall , a great little device with some nice features . Use WMP10 instead of Napster and you 'll be happier . I just hope it holds up better than my Rio Karma did !
  the baterries are more bigger than varta 217 , i need the same baterry , you not have VARTA 217v ?
  My son put this memory card in a full Sansa Fuze and got an error message . I learned that it shouldn't be added to the devise when completely full . After searching online using the error message " Not enough space for music DB , Free 90 MB " , I found the following solution " right click on it in Windows Explorer , and choose Format " . I connected it to my computer , opened the file and did that . It erased the whole devise , and he had to just reload the songs , and now works fine .
  Very well made and looks like it will hold up for a very long time ! I 'm not a professional photographer , far from it , but I don't think you can go wrong with this if you have a DSLR without a huge telephoto lens to support . I have an Olympus E-500 system and it 's great with this !
  Reading reviews on this monster earphones they have very good reviews . Unfortunately my opinions are totally opposite . Sound quality is great but volume is very low . Bass none what so ever which is very disappointing consdering $ 40 earphones have more bass and volume which is also nice and clearI have also ordered a pair of Klipsch IMAGE S4 , going by those reviews im hoping there much better than the turbines .
  I have an iPod photo : consequently , one of the functions one sometimes wishes to use is the screen in order to display such . I bought this product for the screen protector , as many other ones only protected the iPod 's shell . The lousy , loose , cheap piece of plastic has actually managed to GRIND dirt against the screen ( because it 's designed to move around ) to leave some v . nasty scratches . That said , iPod is extremely well protected , but that 's not what 's important to me . I will now have to spend $ 20 buying scratch-polishing fluid to fix the damage this product caused .
  I was just about to buy this piece of crap when I realized that there are other producers of mp3 's like Creative . The Creative MuVo TX FM has FM radio , a microphone , better battery life , and MOST IMPORTANTLY , HAS A SCREEN ! I feel sorry for all the ignorant fools who bought iPods when Creative Zens and MuVos are ten times better at the same price or less . I 'm definitely gonna buy a MuVo instead .
  I own a Lexmark Z32 ink jet printer . I upgraded my operating system to Mac OSX 10.4.11 and the printer no longer worked . I contacted Lexmark and they responded " Please accept my heartfelt apologies for the problems you are experiencing with your Lexmark product . To the best of my knowledge , there are currently no plans to develop Mac ( 10.4.11 ) drivers to support this model . Thank you for notifying us of this request . " So before you buy a Lexmark , think about whether the company will be there for you .
  This thing is made so cheaply that it broke the second time I tried to use it . When I first pulled it out of the package , I knew it probably wouldn't last long . It felt sort of thin and fragile . If you decide to purchase this , do not attempt to use the headphone jack to plug in your phone or MP3 player . The part that you plug into broke off inside the device , which then shorted something out so that it doesn't work even if I use the card slot or USB . I know it was inexpensive but I thought I would get to use it more than once . Very disappointing , to say the least .
  I wished I could give this zero stars ! I took a risk and ordered this DVD despite reading some bad reviews . I wish I would have taken those bad reviews more seriously ! After less than 2 months of using this DVD , it completely stopped working ! Ridiculous ! I had just started a video in it and it was off . I cannot get it to turn on at all . It worked fine for the first month and a half , but not it 's a paperweight . Do not waste your money ! We even tried to contact Mattel concerning this and no response . My poor daughter is so upset that the DVD player Santa bought her is ruined !
  I bought this router over 5 years ago when it first came out , and it served my needs just fine the whole time . I live in a 3000 square foot single story L-shaped home . The router was positioned at the vertex of the L and was barely able to cover the furthest rooms in the house . I finally decided to replace it this year with a higher performance model ( D-Link DIR-655 ) supporting the new wireless standards ( 802.11g and 802.11n ) . The Linksys router worked fine for supporting my wireless needs for web browsing and it even did a pretty good job wirelessly streaming music around the house . It was a little slow with streaming photos though and definitely wasn't fast enough to stream DVD quality video reliably . When we needed to perform large ( hundreds of megabytes ) file transfers between computers , we usually ended up plugging in an ethernet cable , because the wireless file transfers were too slow . In general , for an 80211b router , this router did a fine job , lasted a long time , and was easy to setup . I can't comment about the Linksys support , because I never needed any support . I 'm deducting 1 star however , simply because in this day and age , nobody should be buying a Wireless-B router anymore . I suggest that you invest a few more bucks ( if that much ) to get at least a Wireless-G router with the same features . If you have devices that support Wireless-N and you can afford a hundred bucks for a router , then I suggest the D-Link DIR-655 .
  It works ! There is a myth that the more money you spend on an HDMI cable the better off you 'll be . NOT TRUE ! These are not complicated cables and I have never had an issue with any off brand cables I have purchased and I currently have about 20 cables in use in my home . No issues whatsoever .
  this is a nice little unit but very difficult to use .. one small mistake and the whole thing is a disaster .. good luck .
  Excellent piece of gear to gain more space on my desk . Fit and finish are great and it holds my 21 " monitor without a problem . My only caveat is the screen swivel ( to rotate the screen ) . If you don't torque the swivel securely the first time your monitor will flop sideways . Then , you 're going to have to remove the monitor from the mount to get at the nut . You might want to have help if your monitor is large and heavy . Other than that it 's a great product for the price .
  I held on to my Canon film SLR as long as I could while the digital camera era passed me by , but the cost for the Rebel XTi became reasonable enough for me to splurge into digital without sacrificing my existing Canon EOS lenses . The only existing Canon equipment I swapped was my Speedlight 420EZ which wasn't compatible with EOS digital for a 430EX . I have used Canon products for over 20 years . Canon Rules !
  Doing business with this company was a pleasure . My ipod came promptly and was in great shape . Super quality , customer service , and product . I highly recommend purchasing ipods from this seller !
  Unknown brand was received , not C2G . There are no actual markings on the cable itself to indicate contents , however the cable is noticeably thinner than the real C2G cables purchased directly from Amazon on the same day . It isn't worth the effort to send back , nor use this mystery cable . And other than to say " avoid choosing Amamax for your C2G purchases " , its not worth writing another word for this review .
  We do not have a stereo system and wanted something that could fill up our living and dining room with music . We looked at other systems and they were either too big , too expensive or did not put out a lot of sound . This system is perfect all around - size , price and sound level . It is great that my wife and I can take either of our ipods and plug them in to play music . We put the system in our dining room and I use the remote in the living room to changes songs , control volume and to start / stop play . We do not use them , but there are many ways to connect audio and video players to the system ( it is not just for ipods ) .
  I bought the Wolverine Data FlashPac 7-in-1 Memory Card Reader to take with me on a 3 week tour of Italy . The cost was more than offset by the cost of memory cards for my camera that I did not have to buy . It really was a one button operation and the batteries lasted the entire trip without recharging . There was a charger if I needed it . I used only 3 GB of memory and downloaded over 1000 photos . It is a nice compact , efficient machine .
  I absolutely love this and recommend it to anyone who needs to share pictures and letters with a loved one who is ' technically challenged ' . We bought this ( and the service ) for our Grandmother who lives far away and who doesn't own a computer ( nor would she be able to operate one ) . This is a really great way for me to quickly send her photos and quick updates on our family . I love sending photos to her from my iPhone now too !
  I purchased four sticks for my older HP Pavilion . ( I know it only recognizes 3.3M but for the $ I got the extra stick ) . The installation was easy and my machine runs noticeably better . I couldn't beat the price . The local shops wanted 40-60 dollars a stick . I got them for 20 . I would recommend and do business again with this vendor .
  Be aware ! You won't get a " Cables To Go . " It 's some non-branded cable . I was hoping , at least , it would work with gigabit speed , but iperf reported the same speed as my old Cat5 cable ( under 100Mbps ) with my gigabit router and Ethernets in my local network ! And yes , since it 's not shipped by Amazon , you have to pay the return cost . Here is the seller ( Amamax ) explanation about this cable , " The 100mhmps depends on your internet speed you pay for on a monthly basis " item received was one of our 4 cat 6 ' branded cables which should be identical to the specs of a CTG maybe better with a thicker inner core of copper "
  just got prints back from this camera . they look much nicer than from my old 5mp camera . i have wanted to get a 7 for a while and to get one under $ 200 is great ! i like the way you hold it . very comfortable . i 'm still finding out about all the great stuff it does , but there is a manual to read , and a CD with same info if you want to use that instead , and a guide in the camera to view help . image stabilizer works great ! i bought a double A battery charger to save $ from the start and so far i still haven't needed to replace the batteries and i took about 100 pictures . camera takes 2 double As . just remember to turn it off when not using and you should find comparable battery life like with any other camera .
  I think these speakers are awesome . It 's really cheap , considering they are " Bose " ( look at other bose products . I bet this is the cheapest speakers they have . ) but they still sound like Bose . They 're really small , but they have pretty strong base , and sound is extremely clear . Many people criticize Bose since bose products are really overpriced , but I think this is a good purchase since it 's pretty cheap and has great sound .
  I got this player for Christmas and really like it . It replaced my 20 GB Dell DJ , which i loved , but i wanted a video player . I don't have the " iPod knowledge , " but for those whom never have had an iPod , and want something different , the zune is perfect . It 's screen and video quality are amazing , much better than what i 've seen on iPods . the sound is great , and the player is very simple to use . Plus , i like the music subscription plan of Marketplace . The raido is a big plus too . My complaints are the click wheel can be a hassle if you want to find music quickly ( i was spoiled by the Dell DJ 's scroll bar ) . The software is sometimes a pain , especially if your PC doesn't support it ( i had to download Service Pack 2 to support the Zune Software ) . Yet , with any player there are going to be annoying problems , even the iPod . With the Zune , the good out-weighs the bad by a lot . For those who never had an iPod ( or even if you have ) , the Zune is the best alternative .
  See the reviews below . my 2500mAh NiMHs play for about 75 minutes per charge . Won't read multi-session CDs , and tech support doesn't know why . A / C adapter only works if the player is kept perfectly still , otherwise power is lost . From time to time stops playing for 5 seconds - 2 minutes in the middle of tracks . I have never been this disapointed in a consumer electronics product .
  Great headphones , love the sound quality but after one warranty covered plug replacement it went bad AGAIN after the warranty expired . Vmoda offered me 50 % off if I buy the new model from them ( which happens to get them close to the price here at amazon ) but I 'm steering clear . Stay away from this company unless you like music in just one ear .
  I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February . Today , March 6th , I am returning it and this is why : The package arrived from Amazon . I loaded up the software on my computer , then hooked up the player through the usb cord . I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state . Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player . So after the music was loaded , I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music . The sound quality was good , the player is easy to navigate in the menus , etc .. The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player . I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there . So I plugged the player back into the usb cord , and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer . The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player . I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there . Then I accessed through the computer just fine . All my songs , all 4,500 of them , are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd 's . The player just wouldn't read about half my songs . There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize . I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks . This happened with my entire music collection . So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update . It did not solve the problem . I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine . I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service . It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why . They have the worst customer service / tech department of any computer / electronic company I have ever spoke with . After three calls , never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language , more like a 3rd or 4th language , I arrived nowhere . They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem . No email ever came , checked the junk folder and every other possible place . So I tried a fourth call . This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand , saying " I can't believe you Americans " and then mumbled something in another language . I asked for a supervisor . He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days . Then he hung up . I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature . They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way . So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again . By the way , after all this , the problem never was fixed . Also , when doing research on this product , I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files . This is not true . This player will not play any files without being converted first . I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file . The format they use is absolutely a waste of space . If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format , it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more . I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie . I was wrong , the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted . I would not recommend this product to anyone . As much as I don't like the IPod , I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because : 1 . It plays all my music 2 . They have a customer service / tech support that helps you and cares about its customers . I hope this helps anyone looking at this player . Jeff
  I have paid half as much & gotton double the copies with good quality . Why should I pay for their advertising .
  I have three of these drives and have been using one or another of them for quite a few months . No problem with storage , but the click-to-engage dongle requires a bit of care . Oh yes , and the drive tries to install and run its built-in buggy backup software . This can be nasty under Windows , but only a minor annoyance under Linux because it only pops up a notification icon and doesn't run . For all the users who have had these drives " fail " .. perhaps the problem is not the hardware , but the OS . The Windows USB drivers may just be a bit buggy ( and theauto-execute backup software , see above , may lock up the machine ) . I haven't had a problem with them running under Linux , but then if the Gnome or KDE window manager fails to mount or eject , I can always do it manually from an xterm window . The real problem is Windows users who don't really understand computers . It 's as if you didn't know how to check the oil or change a flat on your car . Maybe you shouldn't be driving if that 's the case . Maybe you shouldn't be using a computer if you don't know how to diagnose and fix simple problems .
  I replace 2 X 512 GB memory in my Toshiba Satelite laptop with this 2 x 1 GB memory module . It was % 100 compatible and had no issue recognizing the memory . I have never had problem wit Crucial memory modules .
  I 'm old-school about my music . I want to accurately re-produce whatever the sound engineer mastered in the studio . That means Hi-Fi , which means big-heavy speakers with flat , accurate response through the audio range . The trouble is , that making these types of systems is really expensive . It 's much cheaper to put a fat , flabby subwoofer and some tinny tweeters into some cheap plastic boxes and advertise it as ' better ' because it has a subwoofer . When I listen to the majority of stereo systems ( pc or loungeroom ) I 'm horrified by the soggy , overpowering bass , harsh tinny treble , and either no midrange at all or worse , midrange overpowered by the resonant frequency of the plastic speaker housing . Sadly , I think that gen-Y have gotten used to this as being the pinnacle of audio reproduction ( never having heard REAL hi-fi ) . I was , therefore , shocked and delighted to hear some REAL hi-fi from the Z-10 's . This is exactly what I want out of a great speaker - accurate reproduction of the original music . Every time I listen to them I 'm impressed , every note in the range expressed exactly as intended . A truly rant-worthy product ;)
  Shipping delays aside i returned this because of its condition . It looked almost obviously used , had a scratch on the threads . Needed a severe cleaning at best . Outer edge of filter had indication of usage & prior ( attempted ) cleaning . Generally in poor shape & possibly the poorest looking filter i 've had shipped to me . I tend to doubt the one i recieved was new / unopened retail . I 'm not sure what happened . It appears it was originally out of stock & they may have shipped it from overseas . Some one probly just tossed it together . Difficult to say this is a ' review ' of the product as i doubt the condition mine showed up in is normal . Can't recommend ordering it from here though .
  This bag is everything I hoped that it would be . It 's comfortable to carry , holds all of my books and my computer . The zipper top makes it very easy to access what is inside without having to open the front flap . I highly recommend this bag .
  I 've had this router for a little over a year , and in that time I 've had to call for support at least 5 times and go online to try to fix it myself at least twice . This thing has a mind of its own-for weeks at a time everything will be fine , but then one day it decides not to acknowledge the password I entered for it . It 's caused me no end of aggravation , and I 've sworn that the next time this piece of junk misfunctions , I 'm tossing it and getting a different router . I 'll never buy another Netgear product .
  Works good . VEry good alternative for those who don't have CD players in their older cars .
  I 've had this mouse for 4-5 years , and I have always loved it .. but lately my mouse has stopped working , so it was time to find a new mouse .. after spending several months looking I bought some other logitech cordless ( and optical ) mouse .. After having had this mouse for 1.5 months I 'm looking for a replacement for that one , so I 've started searching again . the reason I didn't buy this mouse in the first place , was because I live in Denmark , where it 's impossible to buy this mouse .. Amazon . co . uk don't have this mouse either :(
  Out of the box these speakers met and exceeded all expectations . I enjoyed them for approximately one year . As other reviewers have noted many fail over time . Time is up , the speakers are back in the box .
  I had already sent this card back once as it had corrupted the images in my Digital Elph camera . I am not a professional photographer , but I did get a bit tired of waiting for the pictures to write to the card after taking photos . I would recommend a newer / faster card than this .
  Great lightweight headphones . Stay in place through all activities and they 're the only ones that don't make my ears hurt .
  Incompatible with some newer blu-ray discs : firmware ' upgrade ' lost sound and visual quality for all dvds , with no way to revert to the earlier firmware . Samsung support is very , very poor on this : they said we 'd have to phone every few weeks until their engineers released a new patch , and we could not watch anything until then . This player is also very slow to load , and hangs from time to time .
  I 've really enjoyed my palm pilot , it really has been so useful with my doctor appointments , etc . I 'm really happy I bought . G Minor
  I purchased this tv on Jan . 22 , 2008 and had no problems at all until about Mar . 11 , 2008 . Just a few weeks over the time limit to send it back to Amazon and get a replacement . Then the high pitched sound started . Once the tv was on for an hour or two it would develope a high pitched whine coming from the back of the set and continued the whole time the set was on . I contacted Samsung and they had me send it to NJ for repairs . Well , I got the set back from NJ today ( after almost 3 weeks ) and it doesn't even look like the same set . When I sent it in for repair I sent it in the original box with all original packing and it arrived today in a different box with different packing . My brand new tv ( barely 3 months old ) that left here without a mark or scratch on it , was covered in scratches , back and front . Further unpacking revealed a 1 " diameter hole in the front left corner that was broken out of the set along with pieces of plasitc that just fell out of the packing . I was also completely missing the oval base plate that I originaly sent . I contacted Samsung again and they said to return it once again to the repair shop in NJ to see what they had to say about it ? So much for Samsung 's warranty and customer service , it 's beginning to look like I 'm out almost $ 700.00 for a beat up , broken , missing parts tv . It 's really a shame too because before the noise started up and I had to send it in for repairs it was a nice tv and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it . All I can say is " Good Luck " if you purchase this set and I hope that you don't encounter the noise and have to send it to NJ for repairs .
  I was looking forward to this product because I have no other way to hook up my phone / mp3 player to my car head unit ( other than a $ 100 chip that you install into the back of the head unit ! ) . I 'm quite disappointed in the sound quality . I 've only tried it in and around Pittsburgh . Have gone through all available stations including the international ones such as 87.7 and 87.9 , but the sound quality is not acceptable . It is actually better just to play the music through the speaker of my phone . At least it was cheap and didn't set me back too much , or I would be returning it .
  TDK manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording . As long as you have the right kind of equipment , these tapes record the sounds of record albums , radio shows , CD-Rs , people talking and more . These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side . The features of this tape make it good for recording lectures and music using standard , less expensive home stereo equipment . The tape playback sound will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car . In addition , the tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times ; and they take up very little room so they 're easy to carry around with you . Unfortunately , these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you . This means that if , hypothetically , you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a TDK cassette tape , the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a TDK cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you . TDK does manufacture higher quality cassette tapes including the SA ; and these are very good tapes for recording music . Nevertheless , they still aren't the same as a digitized recording on CD-R or CD-RW . Moreover , cassette tapes can break if not handled with care . They can also break if used a few too many times , too . Therefore , I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup . These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review . The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible . If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole . The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording . Overall , TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music , the radio , people talking or anything you wish to record . I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints . I highly recommend TDK normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape
  I bought two pairs of V-moda Vibe headphones so far , the first one split at the connector and broke , I wasn't able to get them replaced . The second pair spitted near the earbuds , got those replaced . They sound absolutely GREAT with wonderful bass but they just suck build wise . I 'm completely done with this company , will never buy from them again . Just ordered a new pair of Shures , hopefully those will last longer than the Vibes .
  Perfect bag for your Bounty Hunter Metal Dectector . I was able to add another coil and a book and digging tools with no problem .
  Yes , it 's nice to have a 28 mm lens on an auto-everything camera , but other than that , I don't really understand what the big deal ( the raves of other reviewers ) is with this camera . The pictures are not any sharper than with my Olympus Stylus Zoom , the exposures are not that great under many conditions , it is very difficult - if not impossible - to stop the zoom where you want to in the middle of its range , and - worst of all for me - the camera comes pre-set with a printable ( wrong ) date , that unless you reset or erase it will ruin all of your photos ! I stupidly took this camera on vacation without testing it first and shot eleven rolls of film with it . I sure wish I had taken my Olympus instead .
  I received the flash card about two weeks ago . I used it in my canon XSI , which worked as expected initially . After taking about 500 photos , I decided to copy the picture over to my desktop . I 'm not sure what happened , but when I tried to copy the photos to my computer , the files were not readable . I could only retrieved 20 pictures out of the 500 photos I took . I brought this from ChiTek , hopefully they 'll exchange for a new one . Anyhow , relability is questionable for this flash card . I never had a flash card broke on me before .
  Its hard to find Cassette Stereo Players for cars anymore But this is a great buy for the price . The diplay is very easy to read even in light , with a built in clock . The sound quality is very good ( I had to change my old speakers too ) The tape doesnt come off automatically after you shut down the car but thats ok . I had it installed in my Honda Accord 1990 ( great model by the way ) whose original one starting making grinding noises . I dont recommend the cheap ones , the installation job was expensive ( professional ) and you dont want to do it again . Cructhfield service was excellent delivery and feedback
  This product worked well for the first 90 days . The highest setting was pretty loud . But at least it worked . After that the humidifier had a very poor efficiency . This is one of those items that you have to constantly replace .
  I own a few different MP3 players and finally decide on the Zune because of the Microsoft name and the 30GB capacity , also because i have friends who swear by their Ipod 's but I found them lacking to some degree . The Zune music service is great , loading music is fast , and video playback is stellar . Overall in my opinion an excellent product .
  Works as advertised on my 60Cx , I was wondering after reading a review that it didn't , it does . Using on a motorcycle so I wouldn't go for the USB power because it seems like it will create a weatherproof seal whereas the USB won't . It 's a must have for me . 4 stars because of the price , yes it 's steep .
  I wanted an ultra - cheap battery operated tv for blackouts during Florida 's delightful hurricane season ( if you are thinking of moving to Florida , forget it , unless the idea of living for weeks without electricity , not being able to afford home insurance , paying California prices for houses the size of bungalows , and dealing with loads of transient people with shady pasts appeals to your sense of adventure ) . It takes 8 C batteries and works just fine . It lasts about 16 hours on 8 batteries so stock up . It made the weeks without electricity more manageable . I also advise you to get lots of battery operated lanterns , headphones to block out the deafening sound of backyard generators , and a gun to protect yourself . Welcome to Florida !
  Based on research I purchased this item with the main intent to protect my lens on my D7000 . Also didn't want to reduce image quality with cheap glass . Construction is high quality . Would buy from this manufacturer again .
  I searched in local stores for a privacy filter that would fit my LCD monitor at work . This search was unsuccessful so , I almost gave up on the idea of having my monitor filtered away from people leaning over my desk . I went to Amazon and found this 3M Privacy Filter PF17.0 for my 17in LCD Monitor . This was the best purchase for my office since there are no ground wires attached . Now everyone in the office is wanting a filter .
  HP 935 not worth it . Please read . Despite all of the many , many flaws of this 5.3 mega pixel camera , it still serves a purpose . If you are seriously considering this camera - please read on , and be careful how you spend your money ! ~ THE BAD ~ - Very slow in many respects ! - Very slow read and write times to / from the memory card . - Slow at taking pictures . - Very slow on start-up . - Not very accurate colour reproduction on professionally printed prints . - Colour tones seem muted or slightly washed out - Battery life very low . Way below average . - 7x digital zoom awful . You can't tell what you 're taking a picture of ; it 's so small on the screen . - 5.3 megapixels does not make more detailed pictures . Only larger ones . For more detail , go with interlaced digicams . - Flash effective for only half the distance it should be for . - Software glitches - CCD is obvously low quality : too much " noise " in pictures . ~ THE GOOD ~ - 5.3 megapixels make for huge pictures . If you need them . - Pentax lens . - Lots of picture-taking options . ~ THE STORY ~ one of my buddies has a Sony 3.2 mp camera which takes far superior pictures in almost every respect . The colours are more vivid and more accurate . The 5.3 mp of the HP 935 only makes a larger picture , because , once you 've reached " Photograph Quality " prints , you can't get any clearer unless you buy an interlaced digital camera . We both had our pictures printed at the same professional photo booth . The result ? All of our pals who saw our pictures agree that hers are better . And , sadly , I would have to agree as well . ~ OTHER CAMERAS ~ This is a sub-par camera not to be taken seriously . Even 3.2 megapixel Sony cameras take way better pictures than this HP.I suspect that you 'll get even better results with a modern 2.0 or 2.1 mp camera , by almost any other company . Consider anything BUT this camera , unless you enjoy wasting money . * ~ THE END ~ Overall - HP has a long way to go before they 'll be taken seriously in the camera world . Given the chance again , I would not buy this camera . Image quality is sub-par . Colour is sub-accurate . Price is too steep for what it is . If this camera cost $ 200 ( Canadian ) it would be fantastic . Because that 's what it should be worth . Bottom line is : This is a joke of a camera .
  I had an old Panasonic PVD-DV51 camcorder and wanted to transfer the images on the tape to computer files and eventually burn them to DVD . Of course I thought it wouldn't work , but low and behold I attached the adapter to my Firewire cable and plugged it into my Windows VISTA computer ( because it had the 4 pin input slot ) and BOOM the Windows application opened on it 's own so I could capture video from the camera . Worked like a charm for my application and for a few bucks it was a lot cheaper than buying a separate piece of hardware to do the job , or taking my old tapes to a video store for conversion . Hope it works for you too . Cables To Go - 27028 - Firewire 6-Pin Female 4-Pin Male Adapter
  I bought this unit back in April-2009 for the sole purpose of transfering home movies from VHS to DVD before they deteriated , or for that matter , the dreaded tape Break . Just to have someone transfer a home movie over to DVD was running me $ 30 for the first 2 hours . I have 13 to transfer , you do the math . I looked everywhere : walmart , sears , k-mart , target , costco .. either they didn't have what I was looking for , ie : out of stock , or they just do not have it , any more . As I knew that VHS was on it 's way out , and DVD is here to stay , or for at least a minute , I began my serch online . There wasn't much to offer within my budget , I seen this Sony and checked out the reviews . After reading the reviews , I figured on getting a Refurbished / Recertified , thinking maybe I will get lucky with one that got returned by a dissatisfied customer . Got a 3 year warranty from Square Trade , just in case I didn't get lucky , and in the 4 months of owning it , I have been able to transfer most of my home movies over to DVD , with NO problems at all . It helps to read the booklet . The playback is just as good as the original . I have played Copy Protected movies , in both VHS and DVD , and both play fine . I realy like the 2-way touch dubbing from VCR to DVD or for that matter , DVD to VCR ! ( NON COPY WRITTEN MATERIAL ONLY ) So far in the short time of owning it , I have Not been Disappointed . Adding , after reading the reviews , it has performed better than I had expected .
  I bought this about a year and a half ago when I picked up my V710 Motorola . at the time , it was difficult to find this memory , and 128 was the largest I found that wasn't backordered . now , they go all the way to 1gb and cost the same price as mine did . And it has reportedly been renamed micro SD . Anyhow , unfortunate for me , the v710 was one step below a phone that could play music from the memory card , although I can store songs and play them one by one from it .. which is incovenient . Reportedly with the V815 you can , and of course the newer multimedia Krazors and Razors can . But , I use it for my camera feature , and it works great to store the pictures and quick video clips that the phone can record as well . I am just amazed at the size of the card . It does come with an SD card addapter , which makes it a snap to transfer pictures to the computer with a card reader .. save buying the Expensive motorola software kit and transfer cables . 128mb is more than enough for my phone , but you can go larger . Sandisk make a great product . Check this out .
  I sent the brackets back . They would not have worked with the speakers that came with my Home Theatre System . I tried , but they didn't work out . I also wanted to mount them on a brick wall . I ended up sending them back and using the floor mounts that came with the Home Theatre System . I should have known .
  Does what it says . Provides a nice case to carry around my buds . No complaints .
  This KVM switch allows you to control two computers with one USB keyboard , one USB mouse , and one monitor . The cables are included , just plug it in . I have two and they work perfectly .
  I 'm an architecture student so I 'm computer constantly using autocad and the such . I started developing pains in my mousing hand from my old unergonic dell mouse so i decided it was time to upgrade . This is by far one of the most comfortable mice i have used . I decided to get the corded version because i didn't want to be changing batteries all the time . nice job logitech !
  nice basic splitter . flat response ( 0.2 %) through WUXGA . DDC pass-through on port 1 , 5 volts supplied on pin 9
  This is supposed to be a special cleaning solution - is it really ? I can't say . I might just be buying into the hype , but after using it for years , I love the stuff and trust it . Have smudges , dust , dirt , fingerprints on your device ? This is the stuff you want . I bought the kit with the press-down spray cap ( it looks like there are several versions of the kits available - I can't comment on those ) . The kit does warn against not using it on certain devices ( and checking with the manual that they came with to see if you should use it or not ) . For what I needed it for : cleaning my LCD Monitor , Plasma TV and small devices ( iPhone , iPad , etc .. ) it works great . It doesn't have alcohol , so no need to worry about it eating the protective coatings . A spray is usually good enough for small devices ( more for a big TV ) - spray it directly into the included microfiber cloth ( not onto the TV ) . Not only does it work , it works FAST . You can scrub at an iPhone screen for a couple minutes with a dry microfiber cloth and it 'll clean it - with the ScreenClean kit , you only need to wipe it 1-2 times and you 're done . The bottle mine came with ( 6.76 oz ) is enough to last a long time . I 've had mine for about 3-4 years and still have about 3/4ths of it left . I was surprised to see this was a MONSTER product , considering how inexpensive it was . Is this a necessity ? No . You can probably get by with water and a microfiber , but this will make the process much quicker ( and easier ) , and for that it was definitely worth the ( low ) cost .
  Not the most well built tripod but it works well . As a hobbyist photographer I purchased this tripod for my Canon T2i . It holds the camera well in portrait and landscape modes . The levels are accurate and setup and breakdown are fairly simple . The drawback is the head on the tripod is made of all plastic so it doesn't feel as durable as the more expensive tripods . The tilt and portrait tilt don't hold as well as I would like but none the less it still holds . If your looking for a tripod to experiment with , this is a good start . I bought it to travel with and use at home when I need one . It will get me by till I can afford a more expensive one .
  I just got this after getting a full sized wireless keyboard and mouse . I chose this because it resembles a laptop keyboard with the touch keys I 'm used to . This is my test run and it works as expected . The touch pad does what it is suppose to do . I like the very light footprint on my lap and the fact it comes with a dust protector . Since I use my laptop for everything from business to entertainment this item does a great great job and have no complaints .
  Takes a bit of messing around to tune all the right settings for various apps . Wouldn't be without it . You can make it as fast and responsive as you want . Love it for surfing the web , mail , osx Finder and of course Photoshop and Bridge .
  You can spend less and get less at the local hardware storeThe build quality is outstandingThe unit looks , feels and functions beautifullyExcellent specs and credentialsI bought three and am ordering several more , the feeling of security on my expensive electronics is extremely satisfying
  The Toshiba AC adapter did not look exactly like the original that it replaced but it works fine . We received it in one week . The original would not stay locked in place , this one does . We haven't had it long enough to say how it will hold up over the long haul . We would purchase it again .
  This is a really good camera . I wont go into too many details , but it is extremely compact , when I got it in the mail I was truly surprised at how small it is , which is pretty cool . The pictures I have taken so far are good quality . I also really appreciate the rechargeable battery . To me that makes a lot more sense then having to buy hundreds of triple A 's over the lifetime of the camera . I highly recommend this camera , you get your money 's worth !
  sure 4 Gb of the smallest form factor of just plain old storage is great . its good , fast no bells or whistles ( my style ) - but who is marketing genius said Easter colors , that what the market is demanding , purples and greens . That way they will match all my computer stuff ! But seriously , beyond the color ( which a quick hit of model paint fix ) , this works great . Could use a better cap , keep loosing it , but it is pretty useless anyway .
  I thought that it was & # 34 ; another flash more & # 34 ; . I was wrong , It is a excellent flash for Canon EOS . Incredible 400 flashes with 4 alcaline bateries only .
  I do not understand how someone has not taken action against Sony for this product . If there 's a laywer out there in search for a class action , they should look into this . I am using a GRV550 right now and this is the third time I start writing a review .. it shut down twice in less than an hour ! Besides that major flaw , this machine is extremely noisy and it gets extremely hot . If you take those three into account , you rule out 99 % of the settings where a laptop would be of any use . I contacted their customer support a couple of times and they were helplessly hopeless - or hopelessly helpless .. They basically ask you to reset the bios . They obviously already know this thing is a lemon so they will just make you waste some time . I would gladly return this piece of plastic if I could . Won't be getting any more Sony during this lifetime for sure !
  I bought this camera for my wife .. I 'm glad she lets me use it . I 'm not going to go into all the bells and whistles listed above .. I probably don't even know about all of them .. I 'll make it simple : It takes great pictures ! It 's not an SLR .. you 're not going to get 1080p HD from 600yds away on a dark night .. but give it a fighting chance and it 'll get you a good image . It 's very small and easy to carry and does it 's job admirably . I 'd buy it again in a minute !
  The card worked for about 20 pictures then started giving errors to be formatted . I formatted to no avail . I called the company I bought it from who then referred me to Transcend directly . Contacting them directly is impossible ! You get no response . My card is currently on it 's way to Transcend and hopefully they will replace with one that works , although I will not use it for anything super important .
  I bought this peace of trash because I thought I would be able to get a better signal-range and 108 MB transfer rate in my two-bedroom apartment ( using with Netgear desktop-PCI card ) but I all get was very low signal sometimes or nothing .. Mann , my neighbor uses a Belkin-Router and I am able to get an excellent signal . It seems to me that almost always Netgear likes to be first to bring new technology , but cheap + crappy , to the market . If it is a new technology and it is made by Netgear don't buy from them AND JUST WAIT , please wait , I am sure Linksys , D-Link or Belkin would probably make something better than Netgear . Furthermore , WPA never worked .. For technical-support , talked someone from India , who I thought just wasted my time . Disastrous -N E T G E A R = I DO NOT RECOMMENDED IT
  Very good quality . And a great savings when you consider the price of genuine Epson ink .
  I ordered and paid for a new unit . The recorder was dirty and dented and came in an old , beat-up box . The remote control didn't work . The supplier didn't have a replacement remote so he is going to send me a universal remote . I hope it works with the recorder . I have puchased quite a few large electronics from Amazon and this is the first time I 've had a problem . I guess it 's because it was an outside supplier .
  I received these headphones as a birthday gift . I am a dedicated ( but slow ) runner , who likes to listen to podcasts or music while I run . I am on my second shuffle , but I 've gone through a couple dozen pair of headphones . I normally buy cheap headphones , and the wire wears out after 20-40 times running with them . So far , I 've run ten times with these cordless headphones . The volume control is a bit cumbersome with the way the shuffle is situated in the headphones , and I usually wear a headband to keep the headphones from jostling or slipping while I run . Other than those two minor complaints , I am competely satisfied with the product . I 'm hopeful that since the shuffle plugs directly into the headphones , I won't be constantly replacing headphones because of wear with the wiring . I really like them , I think they are a fantastic idea . I 'm hopeful they will last for at least a year or two . I think that $ 50.00 may be a little steep for what the product is , but I believe the price will gradually slide as other manufacturers make a similar product . One other downside .. I feel like Lobot , Lando Calrissian 's sidekick from The Empire Strikes Back when I wear these headphones . :-)
  Exactly what i expected . Georgeous item , great for my nikon d200 and lenses
  The lens arrived packaged in the box . Took it out and put on my rebel . The manual focus ring initially moves smoothly then gets kinda stuck along the way and at the long end gives again producing a jerky and unpleasant effect . In auto focus there 's a grinding sound as if there 's sand in the mechanism and it does not focus fast . I was able to take a few pictures but the problems w / both manual and auto focus is not what you 'd expect from a 1000 $ lens . I returned it .
  I bought this bag mainly because me and my family go on many day hikes so the idea of a photo backback was appealing . It 's got plenty of storage for various lenses / filters and whatnot . One thing that really stands out is how well it does on a run through the woods . I 'm sure most people wouldn't run with an SLR on their backs , but it does a great job keeping the camera stabilized as well as light-weight on your back . Also , I can't stress enough how nice it is to not have to take the lens off before storing the camera . Hope that helps !
  didn't fit the antenna lead from a 1993 BMW 325ISMetra 40-EU10 VW / BMW / Euro Car to Male Motorola Vehicle Antenna Adapter
  I may gave this product 5 star if I wrote this review in its first week for its amazing charging speed , however after a year 's usage , I am not hesitate to give 0 star , for the endless trouble it bring to me . First of all , this charger has a huge adapter which is not displayed in the picture , what make it even worse , it is only 110V capable , which means it is not working in other country which has 220V voltage . So travllers be aware , this is definitely not what you want . Then I found these batteries discharge very quickly , leave the battery a couple days unused , you will found they are empty in just several shoots in my digital camera . My latest find is this charger greatly shorten the battery life . Now all of the 4 AA batteries are died in just 30 cycle recharging , comparing ordinary rechageable batteries have 500-1000 recharging cycle . I finally decided to buy a new one to get me out of these troubles since I do not wish to miss the precious shot any more .
  I bought a XD to CF adapter , as per the picture on the page . Instead I received , as others did , a PMCIA adapter which is not what I wanted or needed . For the first time , I felt cheated by Amazon and don't know what to do . Hope to receive some explanation .
  The only reason I am giving this a 2 star is because customer service was so nice when we went to return the product . I guess you get what you pay for with this product . Had it to hook my stereo to the TV and it worked perfectly for about a week , then the family sat down to watch a movie and boom , no sound . Refunded with no problems and the sellers were very quick to respond and help me with everything . Time to try another cable !
  I wanted to play my iPod tunes in my car . I had a cassette adapter but the quality was not satisfactory . I bought the Irock 300w thinking it would be better as there would not be the mechanical problem of cassette head alignment with the cassette adapter . It works . The sound comes through the radio on the tuned channel . The quality is not very good . The signal drops occasionally . I found improvement by moving the unit around the vehicle but since my car antenna is in the rear that is where it worked best . It is a little difficult to control the iPod when it is several feet behind you . It is also not convenient to run a cable back there to have the Irock closer to the antenna . I don't use it . I use the cassette adapter with its own poor sound quality problems .
  i use these for my rear surrounds and am extremely satisfied , great bass for a small tower . worth the money
  I travel very frequently and spend a lot of time in the airports and planes working . I was always uncomfortable working on confidential or personal stuff as people close by would always look at my screen . This privacy filter works great . It requires the viewers to be in a very narrow range to view the screen clearly . I strongly recommend this product . The price point is very nice and is an absolute value for money .
  I love the new Shuffle from Apple . I already owned a Photo iPod and purchased a Video iPod , but I got this one because I needed something to workout with and the other two were too big and bulky . Also , I was afraid the damage that could happen if I had dropped one of the other two iPods .
  Like every other bad reviewer my pair broke within 3 months . I barely even touched them and they just snapped apart . ( Strangely enough , when I got angry and tried to crush them completely they put up quite a fight . ) Good sound , bad quality plastic .
  # - # - # - [ Why this rating ? ] - # - # - # Some 2 years ago , when I bought my HV20 , I did a lot of research on tapes , and the consensus overwhelmingly pointed to the Panasonic AMQ family . So far , with over 50 tapes used , I am a happy camper indeed - no dropouts , and great quality . I am a true believer now , and hence the 5-star " I Love It ! " rating . # - # - # - [ Tape Types ] - # - # - # Irrespective of the tape you decide to use , I learned that it was more important to be loyal to the type of lubricant used - referred to by my friends as wet or dry tapes . The Panasonic belongs to the dry type family , whereas Sony tapes use a wet lubricant . For instance , Panasonic claims that this tape uses a " .. dry type lubricant [ that ] causes less video head wear ( - 4m after 500H ) . It also prevents head clogs and extends head life . " While some on the ' net argue that this distinction is an urban myth - I decided to trust my professional friends on this issue . This difference is not material until you switch between the two types - which can lead to clogged video heads . # - # - # - [ Archival ] - # - # - # I rely very heavily on tape as an archival mechanism for all my HD masters . Hence my decision to go with the AMQ series over the PQ series ( which are a bit cheaper ) . Happy Recording ! - Damodar
  Set this up without any problems ( no tech support ! ) and have been using wirelessly for over one week without any problems .
  Performance of the one I bought is pretty good . But I encountered couple of problems : 1 . The hand rest surface ( and most of the outer surface ) is coated with a fine porous silver color material . After about 2 months of use , the silver color of the hand touching areas changed to dark gray getting closer to light black ( may be this porous coating reacts with sweat ) . Now the laptop is about 8 months old and very ugly looking because of the big dark gray spots here and there . And they won't go away even though I tried to clean . Given that I am used to travel with the laptop , this does not please me . 2 . And in a place near the space tab , the coating just went away showing the underneath white color plastic like material . 3 . Couple of days ago , two keys stopped working ( Left CTRL key and the one with tidle ) . But I guess this is common in all laptops . I am yet to get this fixed . For about 3 years in the past , I was using a black color Dell Latitude C600 . I didn't encounter problems like this and it worked very well . Even though the speed was around 850MHz , my Linux installation was performing fast ( It was faster than an HP Presario 2500 with a 2.6 GHz Celeron processor - I ran some benchmark tests )
  After using this lense only a couple times I knew it was a must have for anyone using the R1 that wanted close up photos . Great product at a great price on amazon .
  I use it with a 1.4X teleconverter and it still give me a very good image quality
  This is my first Kensington product . I use a Microsoft Exlporer trackball at work and really love it ( even though I usually hate everything Microsoft ) . At home I had a Logitech trackball ; one that was thumb controlled and it was killing my hand and wrist . I bought the Kensington because I 'd heard a lot of positive reviews of the Kensington products . I have problems with the curser stalling , the buttons are poorly positioned and after about an hour or so of working it starts to make my hand cramp and my wrist hurt . I really wish it had a scroll wheel on it because it 's awkward to hold the button and control the ball at the same time . I 'm a graphic designer and constantly on my computer so this has been a real problem .
  If you don't want to spend $ 80 or more on the professional-grade stuff , this backpack serves the amateur very well . Plenty of room & dividers for your gear , and two outside pockets for stowing your favorite lens ( or water bottles ) .
  Maybe this lens is great , but Amazon does not indicate that the VAD-RA adaptor is needed to attach it - and that is currently unavailable .
  This is a good product . Would definitely recommend others to buy it .
  I bought this tv 2 weeks ago and I dont regret it . There are plenty of jacks for anybody who has a lot of components to plug into their tvs . Picture is georgeous . I am using my xbox360 on it i am blown away every time i turn it on . As mentioned in previous reviews this and every other plasma tv is prone to " burn in . " Turn the contrast down on the tv for the first 100-200 hours of use to help prevent it and dont leave static images on the screen for more than 2 hours . Use the built in screen burn protection features as they get rid of every burn in issue i have had with the tv so far . I recommend this tv to anyone looking into HDTV as this is my second HDTV . Never going to back to standard tv .
  Perfect fit , nicely done . About the only thing they could do better is enlarge the hole for the headphones , but I did that with a hole puncher for paper and it works fine .
  Just recently got a U150 error : " Cartridge not recognized by printer " This follows on the heels of error indicating that I had two of the same print cartridges in the machine several months ago . I have never bought anything but genuine Canon ink . So , maybe there is a defect in the cartridge and the little " keep the user only buying from us " chip . BUT , all I wanted to do was scan an item , NOT PRINT . However the people who designed the software for this thing in their infinite wisdom chose to DISABLE ALL FUNCTIONS if all cartridges are not in the printer , filled with ink and recognizable . So you must at all times keep backups of ALL cartridges in case of the day when your cartridges become unrecognizable to the machine even though the are the correct cartridge in the correct position and filled with ink . You cannot scan or fax without a full complement of cartridges . Maybe the next version will work in a sane logical manner and allow non-printing related functions to work . Until that day I will not be buying another Canon printer . The reason for buying a multifunction printer is so that each function can work independently and not be dependent on the ink supply .
  I purchased this kit so that I could watch programs stored on my DVR on any TV in the house . It has worked extremely well . You 'll have to install coaxial cable that runs from each TV to this device . That could be a little expensive if you pay to have it done but if you go the D-I-Y route it 's fairly reasonable . You 're limited to standard definition for your video input but I don't have HD channels so that wasn't an issue . The IR receivers for your remote control work but are susceptible to interference . Moving the IR receivers 1 foot from the TV solved the problem . The interference only effects the remote control operation and not the TV reception . There isn't much of a description of this unit on Amazon but Channel Plus 's web site has some helpful info . The kit has 2 AV inputs for something like your DVR or DVD player . You can assign a different unused channel for each input . My DVR is 36 and the DVD is 38 so if I want to watch my DVR I 'll tune my TV to 36 . You can also connect your cable TV or over the air antenna to the unit so all your TVs can receive those channels too . If you receive NBC over channel 3 you just tune any of your TVs to 3 to watch . You can watch different inputs on each of your TV 's . I can watch the DVR on 36 in the kitchen , the DVD on 38 in the living room and NBC on 3 in the bedroom at the same time . I used the 5557BID to replace a wireless setup . This unit works much better . It took me a day to install coaxial cable but it was well worth it . The standard definition picture is clear and the sound is crisp . If you have all your shows being recorded to a DVR like Mythtv , Windows Media Center or Tivo and want to be able to watch them on all your TV 's you should consider this system .
  My daughter received this camera as a gift . Koday Easyshare was supposed to be so great , but I don't agree . I am not a novice at taking pictures and have taken many great pictures with my Canon Powershot . The Kodak camera eats up batteries like mad . There is a delay between pressing the button and when the camera actually snaps the picture , which has resulted in many missed shots . It is very sensitive to motion and pictures come out blurry . On top of that the software that you use to download pictures ( and you need the software to download , unlike the Canon ) is a memory hog and bogs down my computer ( 2 different versions installed on two computers ) . Other than the camera being lightweight , I don't have anything good to say about it . I realize this is an older model now ( not when we received it ) , but it 's only two years old and I 'm ready to pitch it because it is so frustrating to use .
  It 's over priced piece of plastic and doesn't work . It doesn't come with instructions and i just doesn't work . I wish id read the negative reviews before i bought this
  This item is incorrectly labeledDYMO White Tape / Black Print 1/2 Inch x 23 feet , D1 Style Cartridge ( 45013 ) . 45013 is black tape with white print . 45113 is white tape with black print .
  As for the few people who have had problems , I had the same problems with it cutting in and out , but later figured out it was because I had plugged my subwoofer into the reciever ( so when I turned the reciever of , the woofer would turn off too ) , and whenever the subwoofer required a lot of power the reciever wouldn't have enough for itself and the woofer and would cut out for a second . I 'd assume this would be the case for anyone that uses this power port for other equipment that uses a lot of power . Other than that ( if you consider that a problem ) , I have never had any problems with this product . I absolutely love it , and when bought with the " Sony SA-VE367T 7.1-Channel Surround Speaker System " you 'll be blown away . There are only a few products that currently support 7.1 surround sound , but when you get one that does , you 'll be amazed . Even if you are just using 5.1 surround sound products , you 'll feel like you are there ( playing war games with this is so real that you might need diapers ) .
  I bought both the fraction calculator and the see n solve . The brightness of the display screen was normal on fraction calculator and dim on the see n solve . The fraction calculator dose not display adding or subtracting in the same format as the see n solve . If the display was brighter this would be 5 stars .
  The earphones were too big for my ear . I used them to work out and they kept falling out of my ear because they were too big . I ended up having to purchase Jbuds and they had several different sized covers and they fit in my ear much better .
  Able to collapse , not VERY small but certainly moderately easy to carry onboard . Sound quality good , not much noise leakage ( someone sitting * right * next to you might know you 're listening to something ) . Ear cushioning soft , comfortable to wear ( much better than the cheap earbuds that came with my Rio ) . Music quality good .. at least , quite good for using for travel , and helps keep noise out too .
  Big on promises , none delivered . The most use part of this product is the cardboard box that can be used to ship it back . I am very tech capable and I knowledgeable . The USB port is useless . NO USB drives will work on this thing so you can only record on SD cards which aren't big enough to record on the best setting , but if you get a bigger SDHC card you have to use an adapter which goes into the useless USB port . See the constant circle of frustration . All storage has to be formatted with FAT32 but even if you do , it still wont work . It will hang up and stop recording constantly and in only 2 days of ownership has locked up and frozen 5 times . Please do not buy this , tell everyone . Save your money and buy the DVDs this thing is a waste of time , money , patience , sanity , USB drives , space , air , chips , plastic and cardboard . Oh but the batteries for the remote were the only things that worked .
  I haven't listened to records since my old turntable broke down years ago . In the meantime , I have a acquired new amp , which does not include a phono option , and the idea of buying a preamp and all the other necessary accessories seemed like too much effort . Well , this compact little turntable does the trick with a minimum of fuss . It 's not an audiophile product , but I must say that , hooked up to my main system , it provides good sound , tracks even scratchy , warped LPs well , and takes up very little shelf space . I even brought it into my kitchen one evening , hooked it up to a table radio , and some 1950s-era jazz records sounded pretty sweet . I 'm going to be getting a few of these to give to my musically-included friends as gifts this holiday season ! For those of you who have forgotten the joy of setting the needle into the groove and hearing that familiar ' swoosh ' - this will bring it all back .
  I highly recommend this product , the C3180 . I made Christmas cards on it this year , scanned and printed lots of silly stuff , and scanned and printed lots of important stuff . I 've had it for 3 + months , now , with no hassles . I bought extra ink cartridges for back-up when doing those cards , but didn't need them . I had replaced the cartridges maybe a few weeks before . And the software that came with it is so straight forward and easy to use . As for the price , Staples ( or was it Office Max ) had it for , I think , $ 84 before tax . But I wouldn't have known to buy it without Amazon 's feedback . Oh , and it arrived like two days after I ordered it ! 5 stars .
  I found this ear piece difficult to keep in my ear . It falls out often and turns on very easily when in my purse . I would not recommend this ear peice .
  Linksys changed the configuration of this bridge completely from one that requires an adapter at one end to a stand alone unit without changing the model number . The only tip-off is that they have added etherfast 10/100 to the name of the model . Hence , when my order for the new PREBR10 arrived and I ripped into it ( I know , I know ) I found that I had the older model . The spec sheet for the 10/100 sheet claims that the bridge , connected directly to the router , rather than to the modem , will deliver up to 100mbps , the way I read it . And , the way I read it , it does not need an adapter at the other end . After you have programmed it into your router , you unplug from the router and into your ethernet port and you 're ready to go . So , I was cheated by Linksys not changing the model number when they drastically changed this model . I don't have the energy , am not angry enough , to try to get anything done about this . ( And of course , recourse through the retailer is closed because of my haste . ) But , this is the last Linksys product I will buy . Besides their product support stinks . I once had a defective router right out of the box and they absolutely refused to help me . Luckily the retailer took it back .
  Quality product from Panasonic - length is just about perfect for connecting my HD Cable settop to a Pana . plasma screen . Recommended .
  Within the first month I noticed that the router was intermittently dropping both wired and wireless connections . During these connection drops the router could not be accessed at all . " Ping " commands to the router 's IP address were timing out . This indicates a failure either with the firmware or hardware . I submitted an online support request to Netgear , waited a week , and received no response . I submitted another support request , and again was ignored . The third time , I sent a message saying their support was useless , and they deleted my online registration . I can forgive problems with a product , but with such a lack of respect for customers , I think Netgear is a company to avoid .
  noise on the receiver , touch lamp goes off and on when on phone , phone rings when talking on other phone
  Second region free DVD that I purchased from this vendor - while they both started out fine after a short time they would only play non-region 1 disks . Region 1 disks for the US started skipping . I thought that maybe it was a fluke with the first unit but it is the same with the second unit ( different brand ) . I am not happy .
  Though the wire worked well , when I had a question and needed to contact Q-See I found that Q-See had little if not 0 costumer service . If you buy from them your on your own . Don ` t expect any help of any kind from the company . They seem to have no respect for their costumers . Contacting them is just about impossible and when you do get to talk to someone they are of no help at all . Use another company .
  This keyboard feels very much like a regular fullsize keyboard . I found it easier to use than the smaller versions . The keys have a great feel to them , and your hand rests comfortably in position . There are even places to put your stylus . I love this thing !
  Although technically impressive , the DR-MV1 's that I 've had all suffered from VHS tape drive problems-resulting in tapes getting stuck during the loading process . I 've had this happen several times and exchanged the problematic unit for a new one-then it happened again . I 'm on my 3rd unit and the same problem just happened . I 'm going to return it and buy and different brand . I called JVC and they told me that " no problems have been reported with thousands of units sold so far " , but checking the Amazon review shows that this model has several problems .
  I just purchased one of these because I 'm counting down the space on my computer , especially now that I 'm doing home movie editing on it . I thought this would be the perfect storage solution for my photo , video and audio files . However , I was a little leery . Good Thing ! As people have noted , it is ridiculously easy to set up . But , I did notice right away a nasty vibration . It had my whole desk throbbing . Mmm . I wondered if that was normal . Decided to live with it a few days before transferring files . Good thing - The morning of the third day , no power . Dead player . No lights , no nothing . The thing just croaked ! So glad I hadn't moved my files ! I purchased it elsewhere and will be returning it pronto . I 'll not be buying another . I 'll try a different brand this time . Too bad , I was so excited . I 'd give it no stars , but that wasn't a choice .
  The " pull here " sticker leaves glue on the screen protector ! Now I have an iphone with a big bunch of glue on it 's screen .. Would have been better off without this product .
  What the heck ! I thought I was getting a stylus that would fit in my Palm . This is a full size pen and doesn't do me any good for travel . It defeats the whole purpose of just carrying a Palm - now I have to carry my Palm and a pen .. ? I don't think so . Where is that return label ..
  I bought a TeraStation Pro ( TS-2.0TGL / R5 ) in August 2006 . Jeremy at Buffalo Technology assured me that it would be compatible with the Mac operating system . I own a small graphic design studio and though that the server would stave off worries of running out of space for at least 7 years . When I received it I connected it to my LAN , but couldn't see the drive . What Jeremy didn't tell me was that it has to be configured with a Windoze PC . That was NOT compatible in my book . So I had a friend ( a SAN support technician ) configure it as RAID-5 , and reconnected it to my LAN . It worked fine for a few months , alternately accepting and not accepting Mac files , just long enough to be out of warranty when it started really misbehaving . The server was sluggish from the day it was plugged in , accepting data when it wanted to . Now every time I try to write to it , one of the four drives " goes bad " and it starts beeping . Constantly . So I called my friend to make whatever adjustment he does , and it worked for a while . As a final blow , the network connection no longer works . The server has been off-line more that it has been on-line and now it looks to be a permanent doorstop . My purchase of the TeraStation Pro was the worst $ 1,800 purchase I have ever made . I feel that I was led down the wrong road by Buffalo . I will never buy another Buffalo product .
  First , I must say that the shipping was fantastic . It was delivered before the estimated delivery date . Props on that one . Now to the headphones . Horrible . Just horrible . When I took it out of the package , it felt like it 's only worth maybe 10 dollars . I thought " ehh . It just feels cheap . " But as soon as I played a song AT 75 % VOLUME , there was few , if not , no bass whatsoever . Sounded muggy and unclear . Oh , and another thing . The right ear had a buzzy noise to it . I think I got a used pair . I returned them right when I got it . IT was that bad . So I invested in a top of the line Audio Technica M50 's . If you want quality , please don't be cheap . But if you just want some sort of device that can play back music , be my guest and pick this one . I recommend all of you to read this whoever is looking for quality .
  I purchased this set from BJ 's and it was dead out of the box . The service dept is totaly worthless . No way to expedite a repair even for a brand new product ! could take 5-7 days for parts . Can't bring it back because the box gets destroyed by there directions to get the set out . I will NEVER buy another Philips ANYTHING ever again .
  I read a lot of amazon reviews before purchasing this microphone , but I should have paid more attention to the troubles specific to Windows 7 64-bit . When I plugged it in it was recognized immediately , but when I try recording on sound recorder I get such a faint sound on playback you can hardly tell it 's supposed to be a voice recording . I also tried using it with Snap 5 screenshot recording with video , and the sound playback is still barely audible . If I speak loudly and hold the microphone very close to my mouth , the playback is still very muffled and you mostly hear puffs of breath . That 's the best I could get it with the troubleshooting I was able to do . Logitech 's support site has no help at all for Windows 7 ; it stops at Vista . I 'm very disappointed .
  We purchased this player to take on a family vacation for my two children to watch movies while we made a 12 hour drive . We used it several times for approximately 2 weeks prior to leaving and loved it . An hour and a half into the trip we turned it on and there was no sound . No matter what we tried the sound would not come on . The kids were really bummed and it made for a much longer trip for them as they were greatly dissapointed . I refused to try another one from Initial and just got a refund . I am waiting on my Mintek to arrive .
  I bought this camera for my twenty year old son for Christmas . The LCD screen broke within two weeks . He sent it to Canon and they said it was caused by impact / pressure , and he would have to pay $ 150 to have it repaired . When I bought the camera there were no negative reviews on this site ; now there are at least seven regarding cracked LCD 's . I think this is a defect that Canon should make right . Until then , I would not recommend this camera or any of the same line .
  As others have reported , the case fits properly , but I 'm a bit disappointed in the material used . First , it 's on the slick side - I had a similar case for a different player that had more grip to it , giving it a much more secure feeling in the hand . Second , the material bordering the screen discolored almost immediately ; within a day it went a light yellowish brown . Not the end of the world , but the case is supposed to be light blue and I wonder if it will get worse with use .
  we saw this product on telly and had to give it a go given our numerous applications . we noticed our electricity bill reduce quite noticably . we love it and highly recommend this great product . I am surprised that no major retailers are selling this product ! we have been using this product for over a year now .. along with with our energy saving light bulbs .
  I have been extremely disappointed with this battery . I have used this battery for less than a year and it no longer holds a charge . It was a total waste of money .
  I bought this unit several months back for my office . Its clock light is hard see unless the office light is office .. which makes it a bit hard to work . The tuner is analog and to small scale to be able to get any one station easily . I have not tried the CD player yet . I happened to see this unit on Amazon while looking for its replacement and decided to rate it . Very disappointing for a Sony product .
  Excellent meter . Should be for a professional photographer and not recommended for the person that is not a dedicated 24/7 shooter
  This device has weak power . Good luck if your car has one of the newer style antennas for the car . I was not impressed with the iTrip .
  I 'm on my second Sennheiser headset and I didn't even bother looking at other headsets when I bought a replacement headset since the sound quality and comfort from this headset is outstanding . I bought the headset to use originally while playing WoW with some friends and every time the voice quality in sending and receiving was outstanding . . . which I could not say was the same with my buddy who sometimes had to fiddle with things a bit to avoid sounding muffled . I also have used this headset quite a bit to watch movies on-line , listen to music or playing PC games when I don't want to disturb my wife in the adjoining room . Again . . . sound quality is excellent . For the price I 've been quite pleased . Now as to why I am on my second set . . . my darn cat who has a rubber wire fetish chewed right through the first set 's wiring . . . which is why this second set will not be left out where she can chew on it .
  This printer is useless . Lid hinge tabs were broken , paper feed upper guide was missing , ink carrage sticks & noisy causing printing to waver . Should have been sold for parts because that is exactly what I have to is make 1 printer out of my old one using parts from this junk . Should have gone to E Bay !
  Bought in May 2000 ( same month produced ) - used 3 months , then went away for year . Returned in Oct . of 2001 . In December G3 card failed after only 6 months of use on a $ 1600 + set . Card is about $ 400 plus labor of about $ 300 . Quite a bill for a $ 1600 TV set used 6 months . When working liked picture quality , ease of operation , and overall look for average size family . Really disappointed in Sony - thought we were buying quality product that would last for years .
  ITs good .. its ok .. Its nice and cormfortable , but i never knew a 17in bag was like tat big and im only 14 .. so .. the bag felt big and long .. but if ur 17 + it would be good .. Design is great .. Cormforatble .. feature . ss .. wat else u need .. justa buy it .. Its good .. comes with warranty too ! LOL .. G2gFeeli like i have no life
  Despite the reviews I decided to try it ( my luck ) out . The one I got had orange sticker with null modem printed on top . Guess what , it is just a mislabeled gender changer . I even checked with a multimeter . Do not waste your time on this unless you want a gender changer .
  I started having problems within a week of purchasing this item . The fans would just randomly stop working . I would have to tap on it and set it a certain way on the table for them to start working then , in the middle of a game / work / email etc I would shut down due to overheating because the fans stopped working . I realized if I maneuvered the cord a certain way the fans would come back on so this is how I used it for about a month and it not only stopped working 70 % of the time but after about 2 months I could no longer plug it in , the little metal thing that you plug the cord into was gone .. if I shook it I could hear it rattling around inside . I did not save the packaging and do not have my receipt but I know I paid over $ 30.00 for this piece of crap . Please , I am begging you , donate the money to charity before you throw it away on this product ! I couldn't choose less than 1 star .
  PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO CONTINUOUS LIGHTING UMBRELLA KIT + Free 27 Watts 5500K Fluorescent Photo Lamp BulbThe second one does not match with the first one I bought . Different brand and not the same base . :-(
  Though my printer was listed as supported by this device , it would not work ( using WIndows XP Pro ) . I tired it my new computer with Windows 7 and could not even load the software . So all in all , a big waste of money .
  I purchased a PQI memory card and it died after about two months . Although PQI advertises a lifetime guarantee on their memory products and their website has you fill out an RMA request form and email it to them as an attachment , the email address they give is invalid . All subsequent emails to PQI regarding the invalid email address and warrantee processing were not responded to . According to the Better Business Bureau " this company has an unsatisfactory record " .
  Since I could not find link anywhere for the older camera , Nikon Coolpix 4600 I was uncertain when ordering if this would work - and was suspicious of low price . It arrived quickly and it works perfectly . Won't be losing this one I hope .
  Like many reviewers , here and elsewhere , I chose this subwoofer mainly to save on space and to simplify installation - i.e. no separate amp . No car I 've ever owned has had a subwoofer , but now that they 're standard on home theater and PC speaker systems , the absence of bass in the car had become noticeable . I wasn't seeking the other extreme of conspicuous pounding low frequencies , and I wanted to preserve the cargo space in my 1999 Outback wagon unobstructed by a speaker box . The KSC-SW1 certainly meets my needs , filling out the mids and trebles without upstaging them . Even though my Pioneer head unit will control the subwoofer volume and low-pass frequency , I find the wired remote very handy for making quick adjustments based on the kind of music and the driving situation . Some notes on installation , for do-it-yourselfers : I 'd planned to hide this under the driver 's seat of my Subaru , but discovered that it wouldn't fit because of that seat 's two steel cross-members - btw , the KSC-SW1 's dimensions are 15-3/4 " x 3-9/16 " x9 " . Luckily the passenger seat does have enough space underneath - just barely , but this is actually a plus because you do want this thing to stay snugly lodged in place . ( I had to remove a 6-CD changer that I wasn't using anyway because of the mp3 / USB head unit I 'd installed . ) I also tried the velcro approach to anchoring the unit to the carpeting ( using the " xtreme " version ) . Though it wouldn't cling very well , the seat rails hold down the unit vertically and the velcro hooks do keep it from sliding horizontally , the only possible direction it can move while under the seat . The 19-ft wiring harness is much too long for an under-seat installation , but the Outback 's center console has a big enough cavity to stuff all the unused wiring inside . I used the RCA inputs but didn't want to cut the speaker line-in wires . Likewise the excess length of the yellow power and blue continuity wires , the ground wire , and the remote cable are all bundled and tucked away inside the console space , so the harness is intact just in case the next car I put this in requires a longer run . Like many aftermarket head units , my Pioneer has a blue " system remote " wire to turn the unit on and off with the ignition ( a power antenna lead also works ) , but I had wondered about tapping into the yellow power wire directly from the HU ( as the Kenwood instructions appear to want you to do ) . It made more sense finally to run the subwoofer 's heavier-gauge power line directly to the battery , with the black ground wire attached to one of the seat 's floor bolts . To get the wire to the battery , look for a diamond-shaped silicone grommet in the firewall just above the gas pedal . You can poke a little hole through that and pull the yellow wire through to the battery - it 's plenty long ! Good metal-to-metal contact for the ground wire is also absolutely essential for the internal amplifier to work .
  i got it at $ 130.00 on dec , 2008 . i thing this is a good price , and ship is on time for me to go to las vegas
  IMO , U2 is the best Flash players around . What I like the most in my player ? -> Excellent sound quality ( default earbuds that come with the players don't match well with the player though - replace ' em with iPod 's and you will love it ! ) > Compact size > Line-in and Voice recording > FM Radio + recordingThe only thing I miss in the player is AM radio as I listen to Bloomberg radio every morning .
  This camera case has been very useful so far ; it 's not super attractive , but it 's very practical . A good buy-definitely worth the money .
  I previously had iPod earbuds and I was really annoyed by them . The sound quality was sub par and they always friggin ' came out . However , these have a great sound quality for their price and they don't continually fall out . If you 're looking to upgrade without dropping $ 100 .. this is your buy .
  This is my first home laser printer , and I love it . First page out is very fast , as is print speed . Looks a lot better , in my mind , than the HP 1012 . Manual duplex is easy to do . Noise during printing seems quite acceptable . And apparently the toner cartrdiges are easy to refill . A few niggly things stop me from giving this 5 stars : - There 's a fairly loud fan hum for about 15 minutes after printing , as it cools down . Not outright noisy , but way noisier than the average computer , and annoying for anyone who tries to minimize noise . I find myself avoiding printing small jobs sometimes , in order to avoid the noise after printing .. ( The HP 1012 doesn't do this , as it 's fanless ; but apparently its print speed slows * way * down after ~ 50 pages , in order to avoid overheating . ) - I 'm very keen on double-sided printing , and this printer does it well . However , it always prompts me to turn over the paper ( or cancel duplex ) , even after printing a job of just one side . ' Twould be nice if it was smart enough to realize there 's no reason to turn over and run the page through the printer again .. Easy enough to hit Cancel , but still a minor annoyance , particularly when photocopying . - Large power draw immediately prior to printing causes house lights to flicker . Not too bad , but noticable .
  Wonderful lens . Received on time . Lens was as advertised . Lens is heavier than I thought it would be . Love it 's stabilization capability .
  I have worn out one of these ! It took me probably 2.5 years to do so , and I use my computer a lot . It 's also used on a desk where I drop crumbs and the cat 's hair gets into the laser port . And the desk is wood .. anyhow , I 've had to clean the laser portal out a lot because of the stuck hair , which seems to love getting into there until the laser gets confused by it and won't work , but that 's been the only problem until yesterday , when it started intermittently losing contact with the computer . And thank goodness it started working intermittently to warn me " yo , gonna QUIT soon ! Get another ! " But that 's after a LONG time of use . And I use it a lot . click click click .. lots of scrolling .. lots of crud cleaned off of it . I love the light weight . I get sore wrists and don't want a heavy clunky mouse . I also like the clicky scroll reel , because I like positive feedback from my mouse ! I plug it into my Adesso keyboard , so I don't need a long cord . And I like the cool red laser light . So most of the things people dislike about it are actual features , for me . Don't think I ever loaded any drivers . Macs kind of come with them . I just plug stuff in and it works ( tm ) . I am so spoiled . :-)
  Fabulous digital music player ! I use Linux ( Ubuntu ) and this connects perfectly-it mounts as an external USB storage device . It also plays more than just the standard mp3 , wav and wma formats , but also supports free formats like ogg and flac . If you use Linux and want a 20 GB HDD digital music player I recommend this one highly !
  I use Netgear products exclusively but this is a real dog . I bought the ME101 based on assurances from Netgear support that the ME101 would act as a wireless repeater after a firmware upgrade . it would not configure properly , the configuration utility failed to recognize the bridge even after I specified an IP address and therefore I was never able to upgrade the firmware . It took 4 calls to Netgear support and an escalation before I was told the product would not operate as I had been advised . This product did not perform adequately
  I bought this for the main double din outer plate to go around my Pioneer AVIC Z2 . Apparently it doesn't come with that part . It is designed for putting a single din stereo into a double din compartment . It is not designed for putting a double din stereo into a double din compartment .
